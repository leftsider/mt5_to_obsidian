Whenever I go to Seoul I hit up the Cyberria near Hoegi Station. It was my first <a href="http://english.tour2korea.com/03Sightseeing/TravelSpot/travelspot_read.asp?oid=811&konum=subm1_1&kosm=m3_6">PC방</a> in Korea, and it's currently still <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/3016371/">my favorite</a>. Whenever I go, I'm usually there enough that the staff has a good time trying a few english words on me, helps me with some korean tech isues, and mercilessly watches me wonder how to play all of the fantastic games that everyone else is playing around me.

This time it was like my second home, and a lot less lonely. The guest housing I was provided with was a small spartan room in a quite large 4-bedroom bi-level apartment with no other guests, no tv or radio. So naturally, I probably spent more time at Cyberria than normal. 

This time, though, I gathered enough courage to pester the staff slightly more than usual, which they seemed to rather enjoy. At first, I wanted to try and get a login ID for a korean gaming site. One of the guys stopped when he saw me struggling through the hangul and helped me fill out the registration. Unfortunately, you have to put your civilian number in (is this like a SSN? Because I find this unbelievable that they would need this so i can play online go-kart racing....) and the number on my alien registration card wasn't accepted. Man, I knew Koreans looked out for their own, but this is ridiculous!

After that, they gave me a little more license. I was able to do a little more, like a regular would, and they'd come around periodically to see if I was ok. Last night, a girl helped me with yet another attempt at making an ID for a game--this time one that I found on the PC's desktop. I asked her what I needed to put in a certain textbox and within a few clicks she had me up an running. 

That's right folks, for the first time I've actually played a Korean online game. It was way cheesy but, ultimately, fun. The game (whose name I have forgotten) involves picking a chibi-styled character to drop water balloons. The impending splash breaks nearby blocks, which sometimes reveals special items. While you're doing this, the computer (or other online players) are doing the same thing, clearing the board to face you armed with item-enhanced balloons. First one hit, loses. 

I was initially disappointed with the simple mission, but ultimately was sucked in to the online play and the cuteness of the thing. I ended up wasting an hour or two on it. Plus, I was so happy to have an actual game going I didn't want to close it. =o]

I think there's a <a href="http://www.cyberria.com">Cyberria</a> near here in Siji; maybe I'll have to make a trip and see if they're as cool.

About two months ago I sold my DJ equipment. But apparently, two months isn't enough for closure.
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
I put them up on Ebay. I hadn't used Ebay previously so I was pretty pensive about the whole thing. I was super-clear in all my descriptions, very literal in the shipping process and a really cool guy won the auction for a VERY nice price.

The first problem was that the guy was from Canada. Unbeknownst to me, Paypal can't easily verify Canadian checks, so the money took 15 days to be cleared. That was December 30, and I was already in Korea. I had talked to Joey and he said he'd send them for me when he got back from Georgia, also on the 30th.

Joey died on the 2nd. His parents came up and cleared out all his stuff, my dad picked up what they had salvaged of mine, and my neighbor held the gear until someone could get it for me.

First friend was willing but we played phone tag and then he was away for a week on business. Second friend wanted to help but had a phobia of being near places where people died. Missed connections, no pickup. Third dude owed me a favor, so I called it in. He said sure, but didn't get them. I reminded him, and he promised in a few days. Then he got them, but didn't send them.

We're well into January at this point. The buyer has been extremely nice and is patiently waiting, however, Paypal's 45-day (yes that long) claim deadline was looming and he didn't want to be screwed out of his cash. He sent me an apologetic letter on the day he filed the claim and said if the stuff got sent he'd withdraw it.

I'm now calling to the states rather than relying upon email. Get a hold of sender #3, who informs me that the cheapest price that he can find is three times the quote I received from UPS. Also, the tables are at a friend's warehouse so that they can be shipped the next day. A few hours later he gives me a confirmation code, which I pass on to the buyer.

Then silence. No word from anyone if anything has been received. Paypal claim is still active, I have no equipment, I've paid extra for shipping, and if it continues in this vein, I'll lose the money in paypal that purchased the gear. So essentially I've given my stuff for free and paid someone to ship it.

Finally, this is one of the last two things that is a constant reminder of losing Joey. The other thing is mail, which still needs to be sorted out. I'm hoping to be done with it all so that I can move on. It's taking life energy from me constantly worrying about these things.

My biggest interest in this camera is wondering whether it will make the PD150 obsolete--or at least cheaper (since I still want one).

BODY:
Last weekend I found out that 명호 (english name: Onyx), the institute's junior pastor, was graduating this week. This surprised me, mostly because prior to this announcement I never even knew he was attending school. Apparently, he finished his studies in December.

For me, a graduation is a very big thing. It's a major accomplishment, and it's the end of one era and the start of a new (and completely insipid) one. 

More importantly, I've started to have a different view of graduations in the last few years. At first I thought they were long and boring. As I grew, they were a great opportunity to people-watch ("people" often meaning "females"). But more recently, as I now have turned the 4-year bachelor program into an 8-year debacle, I look longingly at the caps and gowns, tassels, and diplomas--wondering if, ever, I will experience in the first person.

Anyway, when I asked 명호 when and where his graduation was, he looked surprised. I didn't think it was that big of a deal, but he was really floored that I was interested, so I decided to follow through.
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
명호 went to Sahm Yook University, one of the largest Adventist schools in the world and a well-known college in Korea. It's in Seoul area (northern, I think), so I had to take a train to get up there. 

To be honest, I didn't really have the money to take the trip to start out with. But I looked at my options: spend a little extra to make someone's day, or spend nothing and sit at home AGAIN. I got up early and headed off to Dongdaegu Station  to catch the mugunghwa train to Seoul.

The plan was to catch the mugungwha train that left closest to 8am. Since it's a 4-hour train ride, I'd get to Seoul Station around noon--giving me plenty of time to get to Sahm Yook U by 2pm, when the ceremony started. Unfortunately, when I arrived at the station to buy a ticket, the 7:40 train was fully booked. Same for the 8:39. the next available mugungwha train departed at 9:35. 

I had dragged my lazy but out of bed and to a train station practically before the sun had come up, so I was determined not to be undermined by a late train. I whipped out the American Express (a secret joy--you should see the double-takes I get sometimes) and bought a KTX ticket to depart at 8:02.

Now the KTX is the shizzlee my nizzlee. I rode it back from Seoul last week and that sucker moves. There are little TVs that show in-flight(ha) programming--with a little indicator of how fast you're going in the upper corner. This morning I happened to glance up at that see a whopping 301.5km/hr. That's hovering in the 200mph range, according to my shoddy conversion. Bad math or not, I that train turned a 4-hour commute into a 98-minute nap. BAM! I'm in Seoul, baby. 9:40am.

Well, I still had the key from the guest house that I had used during the botched Thailand trip, so I decided to drop that off and pay the tab. It just so happened that they would know exactly where SYU was--and I hadn't the foggiest.

Took care of business, headed out. They told me by the bus I took it would be about 45 minutes. Thank goodness half the bus was getting off at Sahm Yook when we got there 20 munites later or I would have ended up in the boonies somewhere. 

By 11 the entrance was already packed with visitors, cars and people selling flowers, balloons and gifts. I walked through the gate and immediately heard my name--It was Onyx! Freakishly, he had come by early to check on his cap and gown and just happened to see me on his way back home. He invited me over, so I obliged.

When in Seoul, he stays with his sister and her husband. They live on the fourth floor of an older apartment building, to say it nicely. Granted, the pad was probably right in my budget range even though in the US the building probably wouldn't even pass inspection. Still I cherished it, and told them so, because this was the first time I had been to someone's house in Korea (excepting Dean of Academics Randy Barlow's, but he's from the states so his house isn't Korean). They were probably mortified by this, but I was honored.

명호's mom arrived shortly after, with goodies and kisses for her baby boy. Everyone talked to me with Onyx as translator, even though everyone but his mom spoke some English. We enjoyed each other's company for a bit, then headed to the graduation.

Man, there were a lot of people there. Probably the largest event I've been to here. I wanted so badly to take pictures, but I didn't want to be led into temptation. You see, my natural modus operandi is to take pictures of the things that catch my eye, and maybe take pictures with them too. Well, when on a college campus, the things that catch your eyes aren't foliage. And so, get thee behind me satan get thee away.....I can't have anything to do with your after Oct 2004. 

I did take some pics of Onyx and his family, though. And one with his girl hahaha(hey she asked, not me.) They'll be up on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/">Flickr</a> soon. 

Well the program was pretty boring, but mostly because it was 110% in Korean. At least I could sing along with the songs. It wasn't that long anyway.

Afterwards, his family went out to eat and we had a good time. Shortly after it was time to head back to Daegu--work tomorrow, for Onyx at least. heh.

I'm actually writing this on the mugunghwa train back to Dongdaegu, which is the next stop. 명호 is next to me reading. All said it was a good trip. Now it's time to call it a night. Later!

Ok so since it's been a while, there have been quite a few changes in my status, location, and modus operandi. I'm assuming you know that I'm no longer in the US. if not (or if you're just nosy), read on.
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
In three months so much has changed. 

I ran aground while trying to resolve the comment spam issue, somehow completely locking myself out of my website and not really knowing how to fix it. I was already in the market for some new, cheaper webspaces, so I took the opportunity to get a new host and to start afresh. That was not without its own installation issues, and I had a really hard time as well as a lot of procrastination and avoidance. Finally, I bit the bullet and painfully hammered it into submission (with the help of a long-neglected book, Webmaster in a Nutshell). Hopefully soon I'll have the old stuff imported into the new space, and then finally get rid of that old host that, while wonderful, was way overpriced.

Shortly after the lack of posting began, Fru and I also started looking seriously at going to Korea. we started getting our stuff together, contacting the required persons, and faxing, calling, mailing, everything. It came down to the last week, but we were both approved to go to South Korea. We were amped!

To prepare for the trip, I started looking for a new computer. Yes, I know that this sounds like an excuse for a geek to get a gadget. However, the plan was for me to teach and take classes so that I could finish my degree. Since we had no idea where we would be and how far I'd have to go to get an internet connection, the best solution would be a laptop. Since I'm very economical and always looking for the best bang for the buck, I went ahead and bought an Apple iBook in early December.

That's right folks, I switched (computer-related only!) and I'm almost happy about it. The Apple OS X is a fantastic operating system--arguably the best ever--and I swallowed my hatred of all things popular-for-design and snooty in order to have the best. Also, since Fru is a Mac user and we'd be far, far away from anyone we knew who was versed in Mac, I took it upon myself to take one for the team and become tech support.

Now don't think I've turned my back on my Windows roots; I'm still running XP Pro Service Pack 2. That's right; on the iBook. I'm still doing tech support for the fam using that slick MSN remote desktop because I was fortunate enough to have a friend who works for MS that gave me both VirtualPC for Mac and XP SP2 as a going away present for an unheard of 2-digit dollar price. So technically, intstead of switching, I've just added two OSs--OS X and Unix (upon which X runs). So who's 1337 now? That's what I thought, l4m3rz.

Back to relocation. We really waited until the last minute to get ready to go because it was all so surreal. When we did get going it was full blast, all-out, no holds barred--and, predictably, short. We left stuff in the apartment for Joey to care for and the place was not as neat as we would have liked. In restrospect, I'm regretful for that, but I'm getting ahead of myself. We left Dulles airport via the big metal bird at 6am, the day after Christmas. We have been residing in South Korea since December 27th.

I had sold my turntables on Ebay (a story you'll hear soon enough) and asked Joey to send them for me as well as be around for some church members who would pick up some furniture we left. I was concerned about the first few days that Joey'd be home alone, so I made a point of keeping in contact with him. When the dialog dropped of after a couple days, I assumed he was in a funk and would be back on soon. Then worry set in. I asked friends to check in on him, only to find out that he was found dead in the apartment of an apparent diabetic coma. I won't go into the details, but I'm very sad about that on so many levels. Maybe one day I'll go down that road--or maybe not since it's still so surreal even now, since were so far away--but no questions until then. I'll always have a spot in my heart for the JAP.

So now you're pretty close to up to date, and for all the things you're lacking you can check out my Flickr pics of Korea (which are growing like gangbusters!). Or, you could drop me a line and see how I'm doing! Would that hurt you so much to show that you cared? I tell ya.

I've been having this conversation with a few people; Is the Mac Mini as innocent as it seems? Most of my hardcore 'puter users are pretty keen on the Mini adn give it praise. Then there are the avid PC users who nearly fall over talking about how lame it is, an how no one using PC would switch when they'd have to buy a mouse, keyboard, and monitor (Question: what's wrong with the ones they <em>already have</em>?). I was almost ready to buy one myself as a solution to a problem I've been trying to solve--an external drive that could be connected directly to our router--so our laptops stayed wireless.

I think that is exactly where the Mac Mini fits in and really does its damage; it's not a one-stop computer solution; rather, it's makes itself an important component to a working equation--and at a incredibly decent price.

Mac Mini Auto--wirelessly uploading from my home computer? Now I need a garage....

Most of the people who are familiar with Korea that I've spoken with invariably ask me if I've been to the public bath (aka: sauna, 찜질방). There are many reasons for this, but it's mostly because it requires being completely naked around complete strangers (who are also naked). Read my experience after the hump.
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
I originally wasn't planning to go to the sauna--a new acquantaince offered to take me out sightseeing. We went to Donghwa-sa on Palgong mountain. The cable cars to the top of the mountains was closed that day, so our plans were cut short. On the way back, we noticed a hotel/hot springs sauna so we decided to go.

Everyone's big on the fact that you're naked around other people, but if you've roughed it or were (un?)fortunate enough to go to camp/gym/boarding school early enough or in another country, you've done that before and it's no big deal. I wasn't worried about being naked at all; hey, we're all naked under our clothes.

The first thing that I have to say is that everything we say comes back to haunt us. I've often scolded family and associates for mentioning that a certain group of people all look the same, arguing that each person has unique features that make them easily recognizeable. I was certain of this principle until my friend disrobed and walked around the corner of the lockerroom. I finished undressing and went around to meet him--only to find that without his clothes and glasses, I had no clue who he was among the dozen Koreans also there.

I took my time walking through in hopes that he would catch me before I passed him. I saw someone squint in my direction and then head towards me....he looked vaugely like the guy I came in with so I headed towards him. Match! We headed out to the showers.

I mentioned that he squinted for a reason. It will become clear later.

First, you shower. They give you some soap and this rag that's rather rough to exfoliate loose skin, I suppose. I was staying close to my companion now, as to not lose him again, and as soon as we finished we hopped into the hot pool.

This is good. It's like what it would feel like if your tub was the size of a swimming pool. I can't remember the last time I was able to have my knees and my shoulders in the water at the same time, so this was a treasure. And supposedly this was 100% pure hot springs water being pumped in. 

After a few minutes there we walked outside (yes out of the building, but in an walled area) to a little building that looked like an igloo. On the contrary, it was a stone oven where we sat and baked in temperatures of 70C (158F)! It was not so comfortable since I had no towel; they had a thatch mat across the floor to sit/lay on but my butt was on fire the whole time. after just a few minutes we headed out.

Here comes the good part. Ouside where was a rock-lined pool which I thought was decoration. We got in! Unbelievably nice, a little warmer than the first pool with more massaging pressure from the water pumping in. This was maybe the highlight of the trip--sitting in unbelievable comfortable hot water while breathing in the cold, crisp fresh air of the mountains. Absolutely amazing.

By this time I was completely digging the place, so when my associate headed for  the next passage way I was right behind him. At each place was a sign, in Korean, that explained what each area was. Since he had taken off his glasses, his vision was quite bad and so he would be inches away from the sign to see what it was. I wasn't trying to stand in the cold and lose my warmth so I started ahead of him as he read. Suddenly he shouted, "Wait! Come back!"

I turned back through the serpentine passageway. "What is it?"

"We can't go there."

"Oh really?" I wondered.

"No. It is men and women together--clothed only!"

Well thank goodness he figured that out in time. Otherwise, I was about to give the ladies a little show!

Instead, we went to a cool-water pool with water that fell from the ceiling, really massaging my shoulder muscles. Then to another hot pool, followed by a shower, the outdoor pool again, another shower, an actual sauna a charcoal room, and a power shower that I must have in my house I build someday.

Finally it was time to go home. Even though there was snow and ice in the parking lot I felt <strong>so warm</strong>. For about 4-5 hours afterwards I was warm like I was sitting in Costa Rica. Finally it wore off and I had to turn the heat up.

Altogether, a wonderful experience. Very relaxing, Very theraputic. I hear that it's common for Korean families to go to the public bath once a week? Maybe I might find a way to fit that into the schedule.

Online gaming in Korea is like nothing else I've ever seen. I was trying to come up with a witty comparison to something in the US or another country but it's just not possible. There's nowhere else where you can have so many people--men, women, children, seniors--involved in one thing with so much fervor.

I've been trying to get "an in" into the scene since, say, the second day I got here. Unfortunately, most programs here are entirely in Korean, making it difficult for me to make my own way.

Then, after a month of searching I found <a href="http://www.gamengame.com/">this site</a>. I nearly wet myself with joy, even though they only offer four games converted into english for FREE online play. 

Imagine my disappointment when I couldn't download the games! Some type of FTP error....I can't tell since I'm not that fluent in Korean yet. But rest assured. I won't stop trying. If anyone out there has "an in" on the Korean gaming world, let a brother know.

BODY:
So I'm back in Daegu. That's South Korea, not some coincidentally-named place in Thailand. I ended up having a pretty lame time in Seoul, and, as a result, not going after all. Details after the hump.
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
When a client asks you to come out and meet with them, you always say yes. It's really important to get a feel for their likes and dislikes, their wants and their idiosyncracies. Far too many freelancers learned this the hard way, present company included.

When a client asks you to come out and meet with them, you have two options: They bring you in, or you come in and they reimburse you. If they don't like your price, they may chose to make their own travel plans for you--which is fine since you don't have to worry about paying off the ticket you just put on a card somewhere.

Thing is, you really need to nail down both of these things. I, foolishly, didn't. So I went to Seoul for other business and stayed around to catch a flight. I called the client to let them know my ticket price and they balked. They offered to find me a better package, which I allowed. The package was a little sneaky, but I've probably arranged close to a half-million in travel plans so I was wise to the deal and willing to follow through.

Shortly after I got the package, I got a cancellation of the package. It came with a request to find my own ticket using the same travel agent hodge-podgery. Unfortunately, the time, day, and season were not favorable for their hopes. The cheapest ticket I could find was the one that I had originally planned to buy--and time was quickly running out. They suggested I wait a few days to get another flight. I suggested I go home to my wife and other business and they contact me when a travel plan is more certain.

All in all, no biggie. I'll probably still work with the client--although a little more formally. And, if the fates have it, I may still go to Thailand. But for now, I'm just glad to be home and relaxing with highspeed wireless internet.

So last night I met with Walter(how do Koreans pick English names?) and went over our plan. He is a member of our church's youth group, a starcraft player, and a gadgets guy with a serious need to improve english. I am and English speaking, games-needing, k-pop fiending former volunteer english teacher with lots of free time. Bing! A friendship has been created.

It's really cool because this will give me an opportunity to keep those skills sharp as well as an "in" into the games and media I've been going on and on about. Plus I like this guy's laidback style and humor, and wouldn't mind helping a fellow geek out. 

We're set to meet twice a week in addition to his daily personal study time. He seems like he'll be a good student so I have nothing but high hopes for the whole thing. Wish us luck!

After reading that <a title="Leftsider: Webbed Interest Archives" href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/archives/webbed_interest/index.htm#a000046">sleep debt article</a> a while back, I decided to try and increase the number of hours I sleep daily. I usually feel like I've been dragged over stones in the morning (especially since we got here in Daegu) so I figured maybe my sleep debt was catching up with me. 

Well it's been a little over a week, and boy what a week it's been. This crap sucks. I felt awful from the first day--like I was digging out of my grave every morning. Sometimes I literally asked Frulwinn to give me a hand to get up. Absolutely horrible.

But it's getting better. Today was the first day I woke up actually feeling nothing. I didn't wake up refreshed, but I didn't wake up groggy either; I just <em>got up</em>. Maybe it's like giving up cigarettes or caffeine, where you go through a withdrawal and then come out the other side clean and fresh. I hope so.

The only other downside is that I'm not used to spending so much time sleeping, especially late-night. I'm hoping this isn't my regression into senioritis. I'm not getting old, I'm just taking care of myself, got it???

Sunday, April 3, was my birthday. 

I usually don't like to do much for my birthdays; the most I'll ask for is a nice dinner. I think it hearkens back to my days as a poor kid who got a card and undershirts; I've learned to notice the love and appreciation in simple gestures, and have started to prefer them.

Generally on my birthday I try to approach the day as normal as possible; it's my time to look at all the things that make up my life--the job, the commute, the tv shows, the friends--and really take a day to be thankful for all of them, since I usually complain about them on any other day. 

This year was no different. Fru had a teacher's retreat the weekend of my birthday so I figured my day'd be spent in meetings and discussion groups. Fortunately, the conference was held at a beachside condo-tel, and out room had a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/8589044/">magnificent view</a>, so I was happy with that. It was the first time at the beach, the first really good spring weather, and I was around a few good friends over here that made it all seem nice. I even spent a little time <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/sets/217509/">at a Buddhist temple</a>, which is becoming a personal pastime.

The next day we visited Seorak Mountain before heading home. After all the climbing and riding everyone was pretty wiped; so I was pretty happy that Tuesday was a holiday--Fru and I could just chill, recoop, and make the most of a 5-day weekend. 

Ji Hoon and Min Jung came over. Min Jung wanted to learn how to make banana bread, and Ji Hoon figured he and I could hang out in the meantime. We went out, saw my student Walter on the way carrying some pizzas. Then we went downtown and checked out cellphones, and we stopped by a table tennis store to buy new paddles(blades) for the youth group. 

On the way home, Ji Hoon sounded concerned when talking to Min Jung on his cellphone. I didn't eavesdrop, but after hanging up he said that she wasn't feeling well and was dizzy. He said that she had been working really hard at another conference that weekend and he wondered if she had overexerted herself. Maybe he'd even take her to the hospital if she was too weak.

I'm starting to get concerned and he's sounding worried. So when we get to the building first thing we ask is, "How's Min Jung?"

Frulwinn says,"I don't know, she's laying down."

I lock the entrance door and make my way up. When I get to the door I see balloons--but only Frulwinn and Min Jung. I'm confused. Is it Ji Hoon's birthday?

"Surprise!!!" 

It was a surprise birthday party. For me! Wow it totally caught me off guard. Especially since my birthday had passed two days earlier. It was totally unnecessary, but after the recent funk I was in, it was totally appreciated.

Some one brought homemade kimbap, another brought a green tea cake. The pizzas that walter was carrying? They were in attendance. And the ping pong paddles? Actually Ji Hoon and Min Jung's gift to me. Yeah I was totally not paying attention. I missed so many clues I can't recount them all.

What's more, I got gifts! Normally I have a big rule that I want no gifts on my birthday; I just want to enjoy my friends and that's it. But now that I'm not with my long-term friends, to receive something from people who have just gotten to know me seemed so special. They weren't big or expensive presents; just small items that said that i was appreciated. I swear my heart felt like it would burst with happiness.

So I'm feelin' pretty good. I really was just hoping to come through April 3 on a positive note since April 2 was Joey's birthday and we've celebrated together the past few times. I must say that things have a way of working out every once in a while, and this time they couldn't have picked a better time.

Saturday, April 2, was Joey's birthday.

Yesterday, exactly one week later, I sent an email to his parents. I don't know what I hoped to accomplish--get something off my chest? Let them know he's still remembered? Anywho, read on...

EXTENDED BODY:
Hey there!

Hope things are well in the southern comfort of Georgia. Spring has finally arrived here in Daegu and I'm happy to see the trees finally bursting into color and even a few flowers blooming. Its a great reprieve from the bitter winter winds these Daegu hills conjured up; though I've heard that Daegu summers are equally unbearable.

I thought of writing and intended to do so a week ago today, but I was out of town and internet accessibility was sporadic. Moreover, I didn't know how this letter would find you spending your day and sometimes I can be a sensitive, considerate person. Sometimes. =o]

A week ago today was Joey's birthday. It's significant to me because my birthday was April 3 and for the last three years I've shared my celebration with him in one form or another. It was the beginning of many interesting discoveries: We were exactly 10 years and one day apart, both left-handed, both computer aficionados, both semi-disgruntled employees of the GC. What we didn't have in common often met in a humorous intersection, not unlike The Odd Couple.

I'm going to be honest, a lot of people questioned my moving in with Joeseph. As Joey tended to stay to his own, not many people got to know the person he really was. I didn't even know the person he was, really, until we moved into that apartment in August 2003. Before that I thought he was just a quiet geek I could live with. It seemed so many other people thought I was walking into a minefield. Yeah quiet geeks can be walking timebombs sometimes but I didn't get that impression from him.

As we got accustomed to each other we grew a sort of brotherly bond. In many things we were on opposite sides of the spectrum, but never in a confrontational way.  I can remember exactly how many arguments Joey and I had: two. One was over God's nature and the other one was over women. heh. Those are touchy subjects for any two guys, so I don't feel bad. Moreover, we never stayed sore for long. I was always joking and he was always forgiving, and we both knew we'd have to live with each other so we took things lightly.

Introducing everyone to the "real" Joey became my hidden agenda. I knew him as a great person so I wanted more people to know. I'd purposely invite people, despite his grumbling, and later he'd confess he'd actually enjoyed the company. As he opened up we had more events and parties people really did start to notice. Non-adventist friends often asked about him and treated him with a fairness that I thought was long overdue for him. and when he came to my church....well...he was manbait for all the single women. But besides that he was appreciated and loved in a way that was more in line with what he deserved.

Joey had a heart of gold. I don't know how many times I yelled at him for giving away computers, electronics, packing bags full of goodies for brazil (instead of Georgia, was my argument) and I think that some people started seeing that. When news reached my church about Joey I got a surprising amount of emails from members who had no real relation to him except his kindness. A friend of mine that Joey had met was killed in a car accident last summer. He was the oldest son and he was living meagerly to send money to his family in the Philippines. His parents were sick and he had two younger brothers. Joey said he'd give and actually asked some of his friends to give. Unbeknownst to me, he put an envelope in a member's hand with at least $500 to go to the fund we were raising. Even the church treasurer AND the parents in the Philippines asked, "Who is this Joey Pharo who is so generous???"(put a filipino accent there for more humor) Many people at Filipino Capitol church prayed for you in your rough times and I hope you know they, too, considered him as one of their own.

When I made preparations to come to Korea, I could see it was a touchy subject. I didn't want to talk about our being apart, and he didn't either. We were a team now, and we looked out for each other no matter what. I broke a few laws trying to get home in time to see him off to Georgia before Christmas, and I still remember the awkwardness, the tears in Frulwinn's eyes, and that the last thing I did with Joey was hug. We both said "catch you later. take it easy" like it was another one of my trips out of town or his flights to Brazil. He said he'd visit in the fall (after Brazil, of course), and I didn't expect to physically see him till then.

I guess that's why I just wasn't floored when I got the news. I was numb, but I kept going. It's a dream or something; something else that I can shake off and it'll all be returned to it's original state. It was about a month before I stopped instictively clicking his messenger or opening an email to him; to this day I still have trouble doing certain things, remembering special inside jokes we or the three of us shared. Sometimes frulwinn and I will run across something and I'll hear her silently say, "awww." Yeah, she's remembered it too.

A lot of people said that they thought Joey was lucky to have hooked up with a goofball like me. And to EVERY ONE of those people I said, "No, I'm the lucky one, and you're lucky you got to know him for what he really is, he never changed. He's still the same old Joe." And I really believed it. Especially after I left, I realized that Joey was the first best friend I've had since high school, maybe before, and I missed him. Now he's really gone, and I really, really miss him so much.

I had no idea how I was going to make it through this birthday. It just seemed like it was going to be the worst time ever, with everything reminding me of everything far away, missing, and less-than-ideal these days. God managed to cheer my spirits, thankfully, and I hoped He did the same for you.

I know a letter doesn't really do much, and I know that maybe it could open up things that are being put behind. but I just wanted you to know that I still think about him and that if you ever want an outlet to think about him too my inbox is always open.

God bless and take care.

Best Wishes,
Leftsider

...and it comes back to bite you. This week I checked my bank account and found that my old job had paid me. Well, the 17th of December was my last physical day, followed by a week's vacation. I got paid just before we left, and when I got another paycheck, that seemed enough. This extra check was an apparent oversight.

Late last night I called the office, which apparently holds me in high regard, and talked with some old associates for a bit before dropping the news. After being transferred to the accounting department, I repeated my story and sat pensively through a long pause.

"....You are SO honest!" The accounting lady finally replied. "You could've just taken the money, and--let me check here--you would have continued getting paid, too." 

Well I was kinda proud by this point, but then she continued to investigate. After looking up my termination date, she concluded, "Actually, you got TWO extra checks." Apparently, my last day was halfway through a pay period, which meant that the other week of vacation filled the first check and there was no need for another payment--all the checks I received this month were extraneous.

This put me in a pickle, because most of the previous check was already gone. Taking both back now would leave me rubbing pennies until the end of the month. I explained to the accounting lady that I was a poor college student abroad with no real income so she was graceful enough to work with me on the earliest check. I'll probably pay in installments or something. 

So now, instead of just honestly returning money, I acquired a lender who I have to pay back. Great. Owing a couple grand was exactly how I wanted to wake up this morning.

Currently in Seoul....alone and in my favorite PCbaang.

I got a call last week from someone kvetching about the horrible job a drifting freelance web guy did in creating a website for an organization. Long story short, I'm waiting now to buy a ticket to Bangkok and fix the problem in person. That's right, I got a freelance job in Thailand.

I should be there no more than a week. And hopefully the laptop will have a nice little connection to plug into so there'll be no shortage on posts. Fru's kinda bummed since this is the first time I'll be away from her for this long since we've been married--she always gets like this the first time I do something, but she'll be fine.

Anyway, be checking <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/">Flickr</a> for pics of Bangkok in the next few days.

A while back, Blogger enhanced its commenting feature, allowing you a wider range of choices in allowing comments to your site. 

Before, you usually let anyone and everyone comment to your blog. This made you easy prey fro comment spammers, so they added the option to allow only Blogger users to comment to your site. Nice. Except I don't use blogger.

I used blogger in 2002. Then I did my own thing with greymatter. Now I've been quite happy with moveable type for quite some time. Anyway, I don't want to have to go back to my kindergarten days to say something about your post on toothpaste. Blogger realized that, and now you can select "blogger," "other," or "anonymous" when posting to a blog....

...IF THE BLOG HAS UPDATED ITS SETTINGS. So bloggerheads and blogspot users, I beseech thee--in the name of all that is holy please pay attention to Bloggers updates and change your settings. Keep up.

I think the most frustrating aspect of living here in Korea is the fact that no matter how much I develop and grow, it will never be seen in this country.

If we decided to stay for another 10 years in Korea, and at the end of that time I decided to tour the country, I would still be treated the same way that I am treated now--the same way I was treated when I arrived.

Now no one is saying that I have been mistreated. On the contrary, I've been most accomodated sofar. Extra accomodation, however, is not normal; it is given to help smooth over the rough transitions--something that should be well through after such a long period.

Still, if I were to stay ten more years, it would mean ten more years of people staring and commenting/giggling about my differences. It would mean ten more years of waiters bringing me forks when I was proficient with chopsticks even before I came. It would mean that no matter how persistent I was in trying to practice my Korean, someone will always feel the need to clarify what's happening with their bad English.

Deeper still, it means that as a non-Korean foreigner I'm either an English teacher or military personnel. I cannot be an average joe walking down the street. I cannot walk through an apartment building without someone wondering why I'm there. I'm cannot open a mobile phone service plan or sign up to many Korean online music and gaming sites because my residency ID signifies that I am not a citizen. Yes, this is even if I spent ten years living here.

There are few things that infuriate me easier than being guessed. When people assume who I am and what I like and how I think based on nothing more than their perception of all people that look like me or live where I do it makes me respect them less. How can I respect someone who has no interest in who I am? Despite my best attempts, nothing short of becoming president of Korea would make the all Koreans give me a chance to be judged by my actions. Even then, any other person would then be judged by my reputation. 

I refrain from calling it racism or prejudice because I want to believe it's simply the effect of a country newly exposed to the international community. I would hope that the generation after me would find Korea to be much different from the one I know now--the one that doesn't know me.

Little late on the offerings this week due to a lot of new developments. Hope to share soon. In the meantime....check out these interesting web tidbits:
<a href="http://seoul.craigslist.org/about/best/wdc/57138164.html">
Rave: I love you, Average Boyfriend</a>.
It's about time someone gave their man some props. That's why men don't treat you nice because all you know how to do is complain. *ahem* Glad I have a woman that appreciates me too.

Yeah I've definitely got a big sleep debt. I'm just waiting for the sleep mafia to come and break my sleep legs or take a sleep finger or something--cause there's no way I can make it up.
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/moxxxxxie/39650.html">Electronics Games Creationism</a>
The things people think up when that have nothing better to do. The only thing worse is that I'm the one who dredges the internet and finds them. =o[
<a href="http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/03/03/samsung/index.php?lsrc=mcrss-0305">Samsung 19-inch LCD works as monitor, TV, FM radio</a>
Samsung is rockin' the mics these days and they just dropped this sweetie recently. Only thing it can't do is drive me to the mall. I don't have a car.
<a href="http://mobilelife.twoday.net/stories/565062/#trackbacks">Samsung SCH-V770 7-megapixel cameraphone</a>
Did I mention that Samsung is rocking the mic these days? It's a phone. It's primary function is to call people. It has a 7-megapixel camera with an attachable lens that looks like a trumpet mute. Man I need one like yesterday.

That's it for now...guess I'll head to bed.

If there's one thing I've noticed around Korea, it's bad english. It's amazing how so many people can be <a href="http://www.greatreporter.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=359">so upset</a> about <a href="http://ahssa.blogspot.com/2005/03/beware-of-hogwons-in-korea.html">foreign english teachers</a>; it would seem that <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/6070533/in/set-129942/">no one has ever met one</a>.

Take the <a href="http://www.daegusubway.co.kr/english/management/index.html">Daegu Metropolitan Subway Corporation</a>, for example:

<blockquote><img alt="safetysecond.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/archives/safetysecond.jpg" width="162" height="180" /></blockquote>

Ok, maybe that one was a little harder to catch, but I chuckled as soon as I saw it. Perhaps only a fluent speaker would notice that one.

I discussed with a few people my dream to create my own position in Korean government: Official Proofreader for the Nation. With my help, and the coordinated efforts of my department, we could eliminate many of the reasons that English in Korea is hilariously trivialized--both by foreigners and natives.

The resounding response, however, is that Koreans really don't care if it's correct, as long as it looks good. And that, friends, sums up the whole situation quite nicely.

I've been pretty vocal throughout my illustrious time on earth about my views on drugs and alcohol. Anyone who knows me knows that I don't, never have, and that I most likely never will.

That being said, I've been around enough weed to mellow out all the bulls in Pamplona. Bowls, bongs and blunts to sacks, stems and seeds--I can smell almost instantly before it's even lit.

I say this because today, for the second time since I've been in Korea, I smelled weed. This would be common on a bus, at a club, or in certain areas of Maryland and DC. But in Korea, weed is a no-no. Yes, it's a no-no in the U.S., but here's it's like, for real.

Here telling someone you had a nickle bag would be like telling someone that your had four kilos of coke in your knapsack between the semi-automatic and the original copy of the anarchist's cookbook. People are serious about this here, man. It's no joke. So the smell of weed on a city street or a bus is ridiculously unlikely. So I have to come to the realization that someone just smells like a sweaty bag of dank.

Thinking about this is really strange, but smelling it makes it real. If someone smells like they just sampled the fire and they haven't even seen weed before, THEY FRIGGIN' STINK. There is no reason on God's green earth that you should smell so pungent and stinging. Sheesh. Take two baths.

I never before equated that smell with bad, but now I do. Weed stinks, and apparently so do two people living here.

Same here. I smelled it first time last year in the summer on our balcony, it came from down below, from my Landlord :P
My husband didn't wanna believe me, a few weeks later I told him to come out and smell and see, there it was ;)
I think they grow it somewhere in the mountains. Haven't found the place yet so.
Greetings, Nicole (today we go to Daegu - do some shopping on "great" Camp Walker ;)

Just because someone does Weed or other drugs, does not give you the right to say they"stink" or to judge or stereotype them, nor does it make the person any less than you or other "drug-free" human beings.  If you believe in God so much, I hope that you realize that we as humans are all equal regardless of what we do.  Its great that you dont do drugs and stay clean, and am nottrying to "egg you on" to taking in some THC.  But please, dont go around judging and stereotyping people who have a problem with drugs; they don't "stink", and like I said before, they are'nt any less human than you are.

*Check yo self.

I think you've misread my post. Read it again; I read it just now and I'm laughing  all over again.

I didn't say people who smoke weed stink; I said people who DON'T smoke weed but smell like they did....they stink.

So, just for clarification....I don't mind weed-smelling weedheads. I don't mind weedheads who smell normal. I don't mind the smell of weed. I dislike the smell of someone who has not smoked weed but smells like they did. Because they stink.

No person is less than me, I'm a pretty insignificant slug with a barely-read blog. Thanks for discovering it, btw. Hope you stick around and comment on some other posts. :)

It has been a few days since I last posted. My quick response is that I've been busy, but my short-but-accurate response is that I had a lot of things happen in a short time.

It's always difficult for me to dig out from under a mountain of new things; rather than sludge through it, I'd more likely wait until it's no longer pertinent and move on to a point where I can start again. This isn't good, but it's how I am.

I know this, and I've tried many times to do better. Still, old habits die hard. So today, I'm writing a confessional of my sins against myself and my potential.

EXTENDED BODY:
It's all Paul's fault. 

Just my luck that he, of all people, would be the one to pick up on it and mention it. He's my boy, but we are opposites in a sense. Most things that we agree on we do for different reasons, and many things we know we just don't have in common. Even our thinking is different, as is our outlook on the world.

He asked me last night if I was depressed here in Korea, and I said no. In truth I wasn't; there are some tensions that I'm dealing with which I think every foreigner deals with in a different country, but otherwise I'm enjoying myself quite nicely. Considering that I'm doing nothing that I'd be doing at home, I'm suprisingly satisfied.

So the topic turns to Korean. If you know Paul and you know me, you know that this is a common topic between us. If you know us well, you may have sensed that it is a sensitive topic for us. Paul was who I started learning Korean with, and he was a major influence in coming to Korea.

However, Paul likes to find the surest way to reach a goal. I , on the other hand like to find an easy path that works so that the entire process is an amicable learning experience. When we studied, he'd lecture me constantly about my half-hearted efforts, my lack of study time outside the classroom, and scoffed at my promises to improve. in his mind, his way was the best way to learn.

In my mind, his way was also the best way to learn, but I didn't feel like I was capable of that kind of dedication. By the time we stopped studying together, I had improved my study habits exponentially (though still I was a bad student), but without his constant nagging I knew my progress would fade fast.

The reason we stopped was because our schedules got complicated for about a month, and he felt my willingness for a short break was a sign of my lack of dedication. After that, he basically was skeptical of any effort I made, So I just stopped--which confirmed in his mind that I wasn't serious after all. 

I tried to resume it a couple times but to no avail. Paul wanted me to prove my seriousness about Korean, but without his wall of inflexibility I consistently flopped and faltered. 

In another great move for me, I then enrolled in a Korean class that was offered by the Korean Cultural Center in DC. They weren't nearly as strict as he was, and we met less often, but the classroom setting was enough to make me at least try not to look inferior to my peers. There weren't enough students for my Level 2 class the next session so I sat out--a very bad move for me. Again, Paul scoffed and wondered whter I really was interested in learning Korean at all.

This is my relationship with Paul. And I tell you all this because Paul tells me everything I know in my head but have no way of escaping. He confronts me last night, telling me to take advantage of my time here in Korea, because I have such an opportunity to finish school, learn Korean, and build a foundation for a successes in the future. He told me that if I didn't take full advantage of this time, that I probably will never be able to reach the same possibilities; I may not be able to recover from missing an opportunity of this magnitude and ease--I'm living in the country whose language I want to learn and I don't even have to work!--and that will seal my fate to a life of mediocrity.

What Paul doesn't know is that in my mind, I agree with him. In my mind I have the same cloud hanging over my head every day as I try, again, to make today the day things are different. The words that he told me last night are the same words that I sobbed to my grandmother when we weren't able to obtain the loan I needed to take classes this semester, and the words that make me dread going to bed each night knowing that again I've avoided the mountain of things in front of me and that tomorrow they'll be there; just older and more depressing. Paul does not know that I shafe these fears and resentments with my wife and with my mother on occasions that I just feel overwhelmed.

Paul does know, however, that he's probably the only person that will tell me these things. I don't know if other people don't know of if they really don't care, but they seem to always say say you're fine or don't worry about it or I know you'll do it next time. Paul tells me without flinching, and I hate it, but only because I know it's true and I cannot hide from the mirror of his words.

So today, Paul, I am depressed. Because I woke up feeling like the bonless entity that I am, doing just enough to get by all my obligations. I'm depressed because again I've decided that I'm going to try to heed your advice and walk like a man despite the fact that I've never used those muscles effectively for any sustained period in my entire life.

And, most likely, I'll sit here at this computer thinking to start something grand but instead whittle away the precious minutes of another day until I can no longer stay awake and go to bed as I do every other night. Late. Unaccomplished.

This is why it's all Pauls fault. Because he tells me what I want to hear; the truth. He tells me what I'm capable of; my hope. But after talking whith him I still have no idea where to start and so I avoid it until it's no longer pertinent and move to on to a point where I can start again. This isn't good, but it's how I am.

You're right Paul. Thanks for reminding me. =oS

This prototype - http://createdigitalmusic.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=444&Itemid=44 - has a great gee-whiz factor, but a respectable DJ spins vinyls, end of story.

Well these days vinyl is a dying art, and everyone knows it.
If you're a respectable DJ, your hitting the vinyl but if your a realistic DJ you're saving up for these.

Yes, people do ask me for advice!



Dear Leftsider, 
I find myself in an awkward situation. I have a guy friend who is single (Boy), and another friend who is as well (GirlA). GirlA suggested that we plan a blind date between her friend (GirlB), so we planned a group outing. 
As soon as the date was done, Girl A kept contacting me regarding Boy. She's fallen for him, even though she was trying to introduce him to GirlB! She wants me to talk to him for her, but what do I do? I feel bad for GirlB....
--Mixed-up Matchmaker

<blockquote>MM,
The ladies must love you! You're very kind an considerate to even think of someone's situation besides your own; many women would say that is a rare trait in a man. but even though you are thoughtful, this situation is mostly out of your control. The more you involve yourself, the more likely you are to be blamed for ruining something that was meant to be--even if it wasn't.
There are two things that you should do in this situation. First, talk to Boy and see which of the two ladies he prefers. If he likes Girl B, you need to pull out of the picture immediately, it's only going to be a catfight between two women at this point. If he likes Girl A, then you should tell her to pursue him and let them bumble their way to romantic bliss.
</blockquote>

Hey Leftsider, 
I met a girl last week who is from Canada. She's hot! We hit it off and I got some contact information. Problem is, I'm leaving for the states in three weeks. Plus side is that she's returning to Canada around the same time. 
Should I pursue her? It'd still be a long-distance relationship, but at least we're on the same continent, right?
--Don Juan de Merican

<blockquote>DJ,
The most important thing in a relationship is communication. If you're going to build a relationship with this person, you'll need to ensure that communication can continue effectively. This means distance is a factor, but it also means that willing participation is key as well. Will she be interested in calling your scraggly butt who she never sees every week? Would you be willing to?
However, this is only important if you are looking to build a relationship. Most people with three weeks left in a location are not looking for a relationship, so communication isn't nearly as important as low lights and the right music. I happen to know who you are and I know your skeezy behind isn't looking for love; it's looking for loins. Pursue, but don't lie to yourself and your partner about long distance liaisons. Keep it real.

</blockquote>
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Leftsider,

More than anything I want to stand out from my peers, but it seems I was born to be a wallflower. Maybe it's hopeless; can I be an overachiever, or is this just something that's genetic?
--O. Dinary

<blockquote>O,
The one thing that makes people really stand out is when they can be themselves. Recently I read that true freedom is knowing yourself and accepting that. I agree.
Maybe you're not a Trump, a Hilton, or a Beyoncé; that doesn't mean you can't shine in the areas that you do best. All you need, according to a man who I happen to like, is willpower--and that is one thing that anyone can develop and increase. Find what you're good at and go for it--with all your heart.
Finally, think big. Even if you don't reach the stars, the treetops are a lot higher than where you started. There's a reason they're called overacheivers; they shoot for what's beyond the requirement. Good luck!</blockquote>

I've gone and done it...I've fallen for a Korean Drama.

It was bound to happen. I was fresh off of two novelas on Telemundo, in a new country with lots of time on my hands, and,well, this one is so cute!!!

<a title="쾌걸춘향" href="http://www.kbs.co.kr/drama/qgirl/index.html">쾌걸춘향</a>(roughly translated by me as "Carefree Girl, Chun Hyang") is a teen-oriented drama loosely based on the traditional Korean historical story, Chunhyang. In the original story there's a guy and a girl who fall in love  but the guy's parents move or something and he goes off to take the exam to become an official. His girl stays true to him, even though the governor has his sights on her. When he realizes he can't have her, he really punishes her--to the point of sentencing her to be executed. Her suitor returns as a peasant, she professes her love to him from prison, and he saves her from death on her execution day (he actually passed the exam with flying colors and became an undercover corruption-buster for the emperor). They get together, happy ending.

I had heard about the show but hadn't seen it until they aired a rerun yesterday. Frulwinn and I liked it so much, that when she told me it was on today, I was there. In this modern day tale, Myong Lyong and Chun Yang are hip kids in Seoul, where she works in a jewelry shop and designs pieces as a passion. The bad governor is now a media bigshot who has his eyes set on her and won't take no. Again, it's LOOSELY based, but just enough to make it work without you knowing exactly what's going to happen.

Tonight was the episode where they part ways. Instead of Myong Long leaving for educational reasons, he and Chun Hyang are pitted against each other by the bad dude and end up breaking on bad terms. She goes to leave with bad dude while her beau drinks away his sorrows. His friend does him a good deed and she softens her heart to him, but only while he's passed out. By the time they both seek out each other, they've crossed paths and actually are in two buses to two different towns sitting right next to each other at a traffic light (only in Korean drama). They miss each other even then, and so the story stays true to the original tale.

They also do this silly thing at the end of each episode where the story reverts back to the old-fashioned one, but there's always something to throw it off. Yesterday they're in old traditional clothes in an old traditional setting talking when one guy's cellphone goes off; this week Myong Lyong's making a emperial seal--but instead of chiseling the features he just uses a marker.  =o]

So as you can see, I'm hooked. I think there's a way to watch the episodes online, but all the info is in Korean (obviously) so seek out your friendly Korean friend and ask them if they know about 쾌걸춘향!!!

Well it seems already comment spammers are out and about, but the new system is keeping things in check sofar. Even so, I thought I might spell out the rules for commenting.

The comment system is intended to share your insight with Leftsider and its readers. It is not a website promotional tool so stay on topic otherwise <strong>your comment will never see the light of day</strong>.

I don't have time to delete all your posts that break the rules, so if you err more than twice <strong>your IP will get more censure than Janet Jackson's nipple</strong>.

If for any other reason I am put into a funk by spam comments <strong>I can and will at any time put the hammer on you</strong> by implementing typekey-only commenting. And that settles all.

The last two weeks have been pretty amazing. I haven't really done much new, but I'm planning too--and that's important. 

It's been a while since I've undertaken any new projects. I just haven't felt creative for quite sometime, and I translated that into a subconscious request for leave. Now, unemployed and in a foreign land, I've got so much time and so many sensual stimulations that it's hard for me to not be imaginative. I'm actually having trouble reining in my thoughts.

So, I've directed my wandering wonderings into a specific direction, and I'm happily suprised with the results. I'm thinking feverishly over them, working them through, and watching them grow bigger and bigger. I'm a bit superstitous when it comes to sharing ideas so I'll wait till they're closer to fruition before I spill the details. Just know that the Leftsider wheels are starting to churn once again, and I think we'll all be happy with the results.

As we get older, our memories are sweeter; and as they grow sweeter, the more they slip from us. We search our mental recesses with intensity, yet eventually we can barely sort out the storyline. And then, it's gone forever. 

Part of a conversation with my grandmother-

Leftsider says: 
   I was thinking about pop pop the other day. I was kinda cloudy and the wind was picking up, and I remembered how pop pop said if the leaves on the trees across the street all blew the same direction it usually meant rain. I remember that actually working, so I've always looked at trees when I wonder if it's going to shower.

Leftsider says: 
   I don't know if that works for Korea, though. ;)

Leftsider says: 
   That was from way back when I stayed with you guys for the summer.

QUEEN MARGIE OF HARRINGTON says: 
   Your Dad went to Virginia Beach this week end, Kim kept house :) You know I don't remember you staying with us one summer.

Leftsider says: 
   WHAT?????

Leftsider says: 
   That was one of the best summers I ever had

Leftsider says: 
   I stayed with you guys and then went home on the weekends.

Leftsider says: 
   maybe around 8 years old.

Leftsider says: 
   wow. close to 20 years ago. I can see why you wouldn't remember.

Leftsider says: 
   I sometimes wonder about those days, whether there was something about tthe whole thing I didn't know since I was small.

Leftsider says: 
   But that was the times when I used to skateboard up and down the street with the kids that lived in the houses next to you (which are long gone now) and when I got hooked on donahue, games shows, and some soaps. I watched bold and the beautiful and guiding light. 

Leftsider says: 
   going to the sale with pop pop on tuesdays and fridays

Leftsider says: 
   maybe even picking  you up from work at the state offices...I can remember that a little.

QUEEN MARGIE OF HARRINGTON says: 
   Pop Pop remembers going to the sale on tuesdays and fridays . So pop pop was the baby sitter. I don't remember you ever being out in the street playing with the kids and especially  with a skateboard

Leftsider says: 
   I can't remember any particular day or series of events, just little things that stand out. 

Leftsider says: 
   oh mom mom....you guys are getting old.

Recently, there seems to be an apparent clamor in the United States over the presence of an easter-egged sex scene in Rockstar Game's cash monster, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Off the top of my head, this is perhaps the stupidest thing I've heard. Let's dissect the news. 

It starts with a game; GTA:SA--quite possibly the game on  the market most unsuitable for young kids. The game is about a gangbanger returning home to help his family gang return to their criminal splendor. In order to do this you must violently suppress and anihilate all pretenders to the throne while doing dirty deeds for crooked cops who framed you for an officer's murder. You beat people for money, screw hookers for health, and juggle girlfriends for perks. This is not Mario folks; there's a reason there's an "M" on the cover.

Now, inside this immoral web of gaming code someone put a sex scene. I must note that there are numerous sex scenes in the story line (hookers, girlfriends, accomplices), but you only hear the scene and are left to use your imagination. In fact, the sex scene in question is also not visible for anyone to see. It can only be made visible by a modification to the game's code which unlocks the bawdy action. In effect that's not even an easter egg; it's more related to a programmer tag--something virtually invisible to the consumer.

So really when you think about it, all the commotion is that when you've tired of robbing, looting, defacing, murdering, counterfiting, and being a public menace you can waste time inserting code which allows you to see some awkward characters act out everything else you've already been doing in the game, albeit blindly. And when you think about it that way, it really is really stupid.

If parents followed the ESRB rating on the front and back of the games their children want, they would already know that this game is intended for people over the age of 17. If this game was only being played by people of that age, this would be a moot point.

By the time I was that age, I had friends who had kids already. A video game sex scene is only a poor reenactment of the goodies already going on. Sure, I don't want a 10-year old watching a gangster tappin' booty either; that's why I don't buy them mature games. 

And if it's already a mature game where they're already virtually breaking laws, murdering people, and being a moral void, why complain about having sex? That's actually LEGAL; almost everything else you're doing in the game is not.

Some people have too much time on their hands and on their private parts to realize that they are making fools of themselves. Their soapbox is sitting on the backs of every reasonable standard, which they conveniently ignore in order to focus on the sensational. I'm really rather sad that this is even an issue.

<a title="CNN.com - Goats, cows offered for Chelsea - Jul 27, 2005" href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/africa/07/27/clinton.kenya.ap/index.html">CNN.com - Goats, cows offered for Chelsea</a>


Why have I seen this story in two different places? Are we that low on news?

Having been to Kenya, I'm partial and would say that it would be culturally sensitive for someone (even if it isn't Bill) send him a letter declining his offer. Or, sell him Chelsea.

Why not? It'll just be more publicity for America's favorite first family. Enough publicity, in fact, that we probably could get a reality TV show out of the deal; and we all know how that helped Paris Hilton.

There are other plusses too. How about the novelty of a Kenyan son-in-law for the Hillary2008 presidential campaign. No one could say she was inexperienced in international affairs--there's a little of that happening every time the kid comes home. And what about US-Kenya relations. They're already ok, but it shows you're really willing to take one for the team (unlike your husband, who got one and refused to admit it).

For those of you worried about young Clinton's happiness and safety, I have three words for you: Trust Fund Baby. She has backing so financial support can't be placed over her head. In fact, her suitor better be prepared to hand his cojones over in a crystal carafe since she's reportedly pulling in six figures from her current job. Altogether, She'd be more equal financially with a retired Kenyan president than with Mr. Chepkurgor. She has nothing to fear.

So, let's just turn our brains off completely and watch hilarity ensue. There's nothing that Americans love more than a good show, and this one has all the markings of a classic. Plus, if someone can buy a successful First Daughter with livestock, I'm sure I could get <a href="http://www.hancinema.net/korean_Han_Chae-young.php?news=1601#news">Han Chae Young</a> for a steal. :)

There are so many places on the internet where you can find unhappy expatriates moaning endlessly about their Korean situation: the disadvantages, the stereotyping, and above all else the closed-minded attitude of Koreans. Well, I realized recently that I've become one of them.

Wait....not the foreigner; I've become one of the Koreans. I don't know when it started, but I see now that I'm on a path that aligns me dead on with most Koreans. I made it a point to assimilate myself, and perhaps I was a little too successful. I guess the only way for me to escape would be to leave the country.

Leaving Korea is really why I came to recognize my malady. Recently I spent two weeks in the US and I have never been happier than when I returned home--in Daegu. Here, where the streets smell and no one understands me; yes, here is where I spent most of my time in the US longing to be.

And now, with some vacation time coming up, Fru is talking about a trip to Japan. Japan? What's in Japan? Do we know anyone there? Can we communicate with anyone there? Why would I go there when there's so much undiscovered history even here in Daegu? Where will I stay? What will I eat? So many questions.....

Rewind about nine months and you probably would hear this conversation:

Friend: So you're moving to Korea?
Me: Yep
Friend: What's over there? Do you know anyone over there?
Me: No. I think some parents of some friends here....maybe some high school classmates...
Friend: Uh, so you don't know anyone and you don't speak Korean. Why are you going?
Me: Oh, just something new. And I'd like to learn Korean...it's an adventure!

Ok, back to the present.

Adventure? Ha! All I wanna do is just keep here. The unknown makes me nervous. I'm a simple guy now, leading a nice quiet simple life. That is, unless there's some noisy bummily-dressed foreigners nearby ruining my atmosphere. What are they, english teachers? Oh no, short haircuts; they must be military. Those are the only two categories available. Maybe I can get another table away from them....여기어...

Now I'm starting to get suspicious. More than one Korean has referred to me as "SuperKorean" in response to my actions. Have I gone to deep? Is this the point of no return? Will I paint a Korean flag on my face before shooting a sniper rifle out the window? Ok maybe that movie is too old for you to get that joke (IT IS A JOKE).

Anyway. I talked with an online acquaintance who's from Tokyo; he says that I'd enjoy it and meet lots of friendly people. Maybe I'll take his word and try something new.

I know. I think it sounds absolutely ridiculous coming out of my mouth as well.

I've been a married man for about 10 months now, and I'm happy to say that it's been positive all around. Sure there are somethings that take getting used to, but I can't think of one thing that was better off as a bachelor.

I'm thankful for my wife, and I think that there are a lot of reasons that God put her in my life. One of the biggest ones is that my love and respect for her has helped me to clean up my act around women. I was born a charmer, but was trained a wolf. Spending time with Fru has made me more of a gentleman and less of a dog.

But I am still a dog. I am a base, carnal, selfish wisp of a man--albeit on the road to wellness. For this reason, I've decided to write this letter to the women of the world.

<blockquote>Women of the world,

Hi there! I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak to all of you directly; it's an honor and a privilege as some of you know that women quite possibly could be my biggest fascination. 

Since I was a boy, I've always looked in awe at that which is a woman. Curiosity and intrigue often got the better of me, leaving me in more predicaments than I care to share. Yet the mystery of you lingers on; still somehow linked to me in a way that cannot be severed.

Since you now know this, I'm gonna ask that you help me out in being the guy I want to be--and I'm sure that you all would generally like me to be. One who doesn't step on your feelings and make your existence miserable all for a notch on his belt or a temporary bliss. One who is all the things in that crappy Edwin McCain song you all love...without being crappy.

So there are some things you need to take in consideration as you continue to exist. Please don't think of these as rules for all men but rather recommendations from one. Okay, in no particular order:

<strong>I'm telling you I'm married, work with me.</strong> I'm being honest and upfront; I know this is a good trait in a man but I'm no longer on the market. Don't tell me that I don't look married or ask why I'm not wearing a ring or otherwise inquire to the status of my relationship. If I was the Hoover Dam would you pick and prod till I break? Okay then. In both cases, the moment I break is the moment I'm a disappointment to you.
Also, don't tell me my wife is lucky or you're jealous (or even worse, you don't care) or anything else that is going to make my head swell. When my head swells there's a lot of pressure on my brain. For some reason this pressure trggers a failsafe which diverts thinking to the groin area. It's not the best auxillary HQ; it's mainly concerned with self-preservation. Just convert all compliments into "Oh, that's sweet. Congratulations." In fact, at this point that's the only failproof comment, so be aware.

<strong>I'm married, not dead.</strong> A woman will wake up and spend over an hour preparing her face and hair. She puts on an outfit that makes her stunning. She poses and positions herself to look attractive. Even if she doesn't want men to approach her, subconsciously she wants all who see her--men and women--to consider her attractive.
Well if you're my type I will. And I will look, because I'm human. And if I'm with my wife I'll then have to see her looking at me looking at you...and try not to feel like a heel. This is why most come to women hate the guts of their partner at least once in their relationship. The problem is that there's nothing we can do about it, but there is something you can. I'm not gonna prescribe a dress code; I'm just gonna let you be a little more responsible in that area.

<strong>For crying out loud, don't be shy.</strong> Ok, this one is my problem, but you gotta help a brother out. I'm attracted to things shy and othwerwise unattainable. If I see you, and you see me, and you smile and look away...somewhere deep in the vast nothingness of my brain a little switch is thrown. <strong>GAME ON</strong>. Now I've tried to curb this and I think I've done a decent job, but as a domesticated predatory animal I still have innate urges that I am working on.
Best way to help me that? Just come up and say hello. I'm a friendly guy, and, especially if you know me and my marital classification, there's no reason for the doe eyes and bashfulness. It's cute, but cute kills.

Thank you for you time and attention. I will never ask you to be less beautiful, complex, and sophisticated. I will never ask you to change who you are. I appreciate and admire you; tall, fat, beautiful, short, ugly and thin. I look forward to seeing you all tomorrow. Best wishes. </blockquote>

<a title="Stones Throw Records" href="http://www.stonesthrow.com/madlib/">Stones Throw Records: Madlib</a>

After a bad nap, I decided to throw something mellow on while the sun slipped below the mountains. Searching through my (painfully limited) collection I decided on the equally off-kilter noodlings of Yesterday's New Quintet.

YNQ has always been one of those groups that I was proud to have accidentally stumbled upon. While record hunting (ah, another lost pleasure!) I picked up a YNQ EP mostly because of the catchy name. Taking the record for a spin, I was groovin off of "Papa," "Uno Esta" and "Life's Angles." I snagged it with a couple other records and called it a day.

Funny thing is, I never really worked that hard to find out more about them. I ended up downloading the entire "Angles Without Edges" album, but never looked any further than remembering the record label for future crate digs.

Previously, In a totally unrelated record hunt, Aou dropped a sample CD in my bag from a guy named Quasimoto. We listened to the 3 tracks on the way home and it was definitely some off-the-wall next-level stuff. But it had tight beats and decent rhymes, so we kept it in the car for the longest.

Quasimoto was just too odd to not Google. I soon found out that it was an alias for a guy also known as Madlib. Madlib....isn't that the guy who's famous in underground for making all his stuff on the $300 SP-303? I'll have to keep an eye out for this guy.....

Fast Forward. I flip the YNQ record cover over and read the back....Five guys with interesting musical backgrounds converging in one premium blend. Wait....Madlib's involved in this? Wow, that man's got some range. I'm gonna have to pay attention to this guy for real. 

Fast Forward. You know, listening to these bumbling beats and lopsided loops on Saturday evening, I decided to finally sort through this whole thing. I plopped down in front of the computer and googled <a href="http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,1544352,00.html">the YNQ album</a>, then Madlib.

Guess what? Madlib is both Madlib and Quas on the Quasimoto CD. Guess what else? He's ALL FIVE MEMBERS of YNQ. Dude. Who the heck makes their own quintet by themselves? And why is it so darn good???? I'm in awe to the talent.

In addition to these revelations, I found out a lot of other projects he's involved with. Impressive. A musical gem hidden even under his own creations. That's pretty baddass. I'm too jealous right now.

<a title="Leftsider superfuture Project - a photoset on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/sets/719205/">Leftsider superfuture Project - a photoset on Flickr</a>

So I finally put some action behind my constant blabbing, and I've started making the map of Daegu that's so desparately needed. The ironic thing about this project is that if I had started this when I got here, I probably would have gotten some use out of it. As it stands, it'll probably be something to give to the expat/foreigner-friendly community as we make our exit. With our contract up in December, it seems like it's over all so soon.

Anyway, I'm thinking ahead with dread to the actual submit form and online application of the map and feeling knots in my stomach. Did I ever mention that I totally skipped out on the lessons about form submission when learning HTML? Backend has so not been my thing. I guess that's another thing to  conquer.

Actually, I'm thinking that maybe someone (Ed! ED! ED!!!!) might figure out a newer, sleeker method for interactivity (Cho! Are you listening????). That would actually give my map an edge over it's model, the <a href="http://www.superfuture.com">superfuture</a> maps.

And then, when they come to me asking how I did it I'll not reply to their emails in much the same way they didn't answer mine. *evil laugh*

BODY:
Being the product of a small, minimally educated, rural community, I am naturally fitted with some intrinsic habits and philosophies that govern how I act and react. In general, these hometown character traits are admirable; but for the sake  of progress I've decided it necessary to include them in my occasional self-evaluation processes.

Why? I've discovered that a few of the precepts and tenets which define my being are limiting by nature. In order to surpass expectations, I need to have an open-ended structure; something that can expand or adjust to future development. And, most importantly, creativity grows best when not stiffled.

Boy, do I have stiffling. I'm notoriously enslaved to order and balance. I get lost in the details of homeostasis. I'll eat half a carton of ice cream trying to make it level. I religiously relegate my daily accessories to the same pockets, and then place them in the same locations when I return home. 

Today I decided to study some Korean, but unfortunately I hadn't put my things away; my wife had placed my books in a place of her choosing. Looking for them threw me out of sync, and when I discovered she had taken my pen (or presumably placed it in another location) I was just short of exasperated. I can't study because I'm missing <em>that pen</em>.

I contemplated this issue in my bound book recently:

<blockquote>
Creativity and form do not follow the same path. I pride myself in being a slave to pattern and form, yet I wonder why I cannot be creative--be innovative. I wonder why I can't find the thing that will permanently remove me from this (or any other) rut I'm in.

Well, to get out of a rut there are only two successful courses of action:
<blockquote>
1. Carve an alternate path. Without help from a second party, this is practically an impossibility. No one can really be in a rut AND carve a diverging path. Perhaps that person never really was in a rut.
Lots of people care about me and my wellbeing, but none of them care about me enough to intervene and provide an alternative for something that isn't life-endangering. Even if they did, my analytical arguments would probably deter them anyway.

2.Go airborne. Place a leverage somewhere in your circuit and, next time around, watch it fly. When you're airborne you see all the things that surrounded you from a different perspective...they seem so small. You'll wonder how they ever enamored you.
Problem is, if you're a slave to pattern and form like I, the option is useless. This is the path of creativity, not order. So, not knowing what else to do, you'll simply observe analytically, enjoying the the experience for what it is. Then you'll sink right back into your rut and hopefully forget about the whole experience...because otherwise you're gonna feel really low.</blockquote></blockquote>

This week I read a really great quote by Christopher Morley: "Read, every day, something no one else is reading. Think, every day, something no one else is thinking. Do, every day, something no one else would be silly enough to do. It is bad for the mind to be always part of unanimity."

Now that, my friends, is not country thinking; that's the fertile crescent of creative productivity. So I'm gonna venture out, listen to my music in shuffle, put my cellphone in my right pocket, write with a random pen, dream a new dream, and hopefully combat the stagnation of my system.

I've got 3 of them... 2 thanks to you... but I have the sneaking suspicion that you're posting them to show off your broad range of music rather than to help the lack of fluidity(?) in my music stream.

I've decided to approach my web findings a little differently. 

In my world, I drop interesting links into my bookmark folder to be reviewed and sorted at a later date(usually Mondays and Fridays). Then, I periodically go through and read, sort and/or drop them. Tangentally, I've got a bookmarks folder that you wouldn't believe. Not in the least bit cluttered, either.

In Leftsider, as a direct result of this new schedule, I'll probably post most web findings in groups rather than individual entries. The only exception is if there's something exceptional(duh) or if I'd like to comment/wax philosophical.

Well it's Monday, so here goes:


<a title="BBC NEWS | World | Middle East | Released Palestinians return home" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4282925.stm">BBC NEWS: Released Palestinians return home</a>
Quite possibly the most boring headline I've read this year. Luckily I heard the news elsewhere; there's no way that title would have piqued my interest enough to merit a click.
<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6998205/?GT1=6190">Baby stable after second head removed</a>
Now here's the exact opposite; I couldn't click fast enough. I'm having a moral crises right now whether to feel sad for the other head; it had no body, lungs, stomach....but was "...capable of smiling and blinking..."OMG!!!
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,66642,00.html">Wired News: Office Sweeties Have No Secrets</a>
Tell me something I don't know. I know people on both sides of that story, so it's not an exception, people; it's a fact. Save it for home...
<a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/danger/paris-hiltons-sidekick-ii-hacked-what-about-yours-033637.php">Gizmodo: Paris Hilton's Sidekick II Hacked</a> (AGAIN)
I have a soft spot for this girl. She's enviously rich, spoiled rotten, and seemingly clueless to everyday reality. Yet I find something about her sweet, kind and charming. Plus I totally stole my current word "hot" from her a la <em>Simple Life Season 1</em>. Still, fool me twice....? All said, her mobile pics gallery is 35x better than anyone else's I've seen...<strong>NSFW BOOBIES!!!</strong>

Got any info? let a brother know.

Had a not-bad time this weekend at Jiri mountain; got a surprising amount of time to sit and think about a few things, which was nice. Now that I'm back though, it's business as (recently) unusual.

Got a request to do some print design (?) and I agreed (???). Typical of someone who asks me to do something I have never advertised an expertise in, they need about 100 pages of content completely reformated. In 10 days. The project was mailed to me Friday afternoon, and man was it ugly. 

So I'm starting on that. Knocked out about 20% last night; I'll try and do more today. Ultimately I'm just playing wage slave and doing all the dirty work while I get Fru (the REAL print designer) to make a layout design that I'll deal with applying to all the content. We'll see how it goes.

Even so, I'm going to still try and keep up with posting. I need to. I'm obligated to. If I don't, a 3-legged gorilla will shoot rubberbands at me. 

I think it's time for my medication. Cheers till next time. =o]

While I've always secretly looked for admiration from my peers, I've never wanted to be a role model. I think that, in general, looking up to me is looking sideways at best. At worst, you could be swimming towards the bottom of the pool.

Yesterday we hung out with 지훈 and 민정 downtown and had a really nice time. Near the end of our time hanging out, however, we started talking a lot about relationshipss and marital woes. And when I say "talked" I mean they talked; we listened.

I've noticed a few other times where they talked to us candidly about issues they face. They've even told us of things that we do that they've modeled in their own relationship. In short, I'm flattered; but in the long run I'm concerned.

Frulwinn and I have a good relationship. Not great, though pretty fantastic. We make our own rules and make a point not to follow suit for simplicity's sake. We do what we do because it works for us; so someone else finding our relationship appealing is refreshing only when you understand our philosophy.

I have enough problems of my own without worrying if my solutions fare well for the good of the common people. I am the head of a two-person party, not the CEO of married life. It all adds a little stress to my life since I do care for others.

I guess I should be grateful for an audience for my philosophies, but I just wanna do people right, you know?

Spent another day mostly downtown; this time with Robert "Whatitis" from the other Daegu SDA language institute. Initially we had wanted to get together and take the Daegu City Bus Tour, but we found out too late that is was an all-day tour which starts at 10am. Not wanting to go back to the construction zone that is our place, we just went downtown.

When I go downtown these days, I feel like a pet that has been kept inside too long. In the same way that they run around and sniffing every leg, marking every tree, I feel that I'm amazed by downtown's wares not for any exceptional qualities that they possess--rather, it's just because I'm deprived.

With today being the third time I've hit the strip in four days I had to ask myself, "What is really so cool about this place?" It's definitely not the <a href="http://www.twin-music.com/azlyrics/c_file/songs/clark/down.html">downtown</a> I knew. I haven't seen any jazz cafés, lounges, eclectgic bookstores, record shops, skate parks, international cuisines, or street art. I've never been able to get someone to accopmany me downtown on a late-night meandering (and the 30,000won cab ride back prohibits me from doing it solo). With all the things I love so much so rare, it's no wonder I'm like a 15-year old at the mall without the 'rents. 

I've got some ideas for remedying this malady. I'll fill you in on it soon.

BODY:
This weekend we actually went out. And when I say "went out" in reference to a weekend, I am saying that we did not get home until well into the next day.

This is something that I love doing, but unfortunately it's the first successful time I've had an opportunity to since I've moved here. Partly because of location, partly because of timing, partly because of scheduling conflicts--and completely to my chagrin.

This time though, we had already made plans to be out late. We were hanging with a party that isn't known for wee-hours activities, so we didn't expect much. But after the participants exchanged farewells, Fru and I and a friend wandered towards the scene to get a taxi. Then we thought, hey, we're already here....

Two hours later all three of us are on the stage in front of the DJ, dancing like crazy, hyping up the crowd and having a good time. It was a hip-hop styled club, but these days I can't be picky. I think I might faint from joy anyway if I found a place that spun some nice House. 

Faded to sleep around 4...*sigh* Good times. Kinda made me miss home, but definitely quenched a thirst. When's the next outing? ;)

Why does everyone decide to message me while I'm set to away? No one messages when I'm set to available....

What is up with my ISP??? I can get 10mbps up/100mbps down for w36,000/mo with KT Megapass but with my stupid ISP I'm getting speeds of 5-800kpbs DOWN for w35,000. Huh???

Why do I bother asking for help? I ask the secretary to call my ISP and  find out my login and password for online services....she calls schedules a service technician to come out. *groan*

Why am I using a Mac in Korea? Most people here have trouble understanding I'm not on PC; I DON'T USE Windows ANYTHING. No matter how many times you hit windows commands on my APPLE keyboard, you're not going to go anywhere. And there's no "X" at the top right. No, that button is not an "X" and I'm going to throttle you in 5 seconds...

Why do service technicians love to hate on my router? This is a bi-continental issue; anything that doesn't work or doesn't work well that you can't find must be the router. What did my router do to you?

It's really hard for me to not feel excluded when I can't play online games, shop online, or log in to many Korean portals because it requires a citizen's (not resident's) ID number. Way to keep it in the family...

And what the heck is up with Camino when it hits a graphic intensive site? All Korean portals take my browser to a crawl. And I'm totally not ok with the entire community

How'd I miss this one?

I've always feared that my intentions of always looking for the next best thing made me an anti-hipster hipster. Hugh at gapingvoid re-encourages me to not tolerate the hype.

Yes, I am posting right now from an iBook. I don't hate Apple; I just prefer windows. In fact, I only purchased this notebook after knowing I could install XP on it (yes, I run windows on my iBook) I now do tech support for my wife's powerbook as well as for my family's windows machines at home.

OS X is probably the best operating system I've used. However using X involves an almost philosophical change in how you think and do things; something that is counter-intuitive and inefficient for me. I've become much more proficient on a Mac over the last 9 months,  but isn't progress--that's recooperation.

When I get back home, I'll retrive my trusty PC (or build another) and definitely transition back.

<a title="Singapore Airlines - Executive Economy Class" href="http://www.executiveeconomy.com/">Singapore Airlines - Executive Economy Class</a>

I think this is a good idea, especially for fledgling travelwarriors (like me) who do their share, but not enough to earn regular bump-ups. The airline known for the best service consistently seeks out new ways to make a better experience.

I'm most excited by the <em>passenger lounge</em>. Sure they tell you to take time on long trips to stretch and stand, but there's rarely anywhere in economy to accomodate that. What generally happens is an uneasy mingle around the lavatories--people loitering, and people wondering if the loiterers are in line for the bathroom.

Here, there's a space specifically allocated for this, complete with complimentary snacks for social lubricant. Genius; I imagine the atmosphere of the entire cabin improving by this single addition. 

What would you do if you to improve your in-flight environment?

Finally got around to updating MoveableType. I mentioned it long before, but I dread the upgrades.

As it turns out, I had some dead ends on this installation as well, but most of them ironed out pretty smoothly. A big word of THANKS goes to whoever was involved in the vast overhaul the manual and knowledgebase was given; that thing is vastly easier to use.

So here are some of the ideas I've come up with to put the "In" back in international living--cause heaven knows I've been feeling so "out."
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
Supermap!!!
One of the things that's both interesting and a little frustrating about Daegu 시내 (Downtown) is that is't really tight and twisty with less signage the further you get in. By the time you get to the hotspots there are no signs at all--so finding something you found before or telling someone where to find something is impossible.

So I've decided to use a portion of my free time to make a Superfuture-styled map. I lay out the streets, mark them, and then spend time marking the things that I think should be marked. The fact that their reason for making superfuture maps is related to my reason, I think it's a project that's more than just cool factor.

Korean Classes!
Yeah it's about time. At the Daegu Tourist Information Center yesterday, I finally got some info about Korean classes for foreigners. While there are no actual korean language institutes in Daegu that I'm aware of, all of Daegu's universities have korean language classes for foreigners. They range from approximately 200,000 to 1,000,000 won and have classes for seven weeks or more. 

As this will probably still be cheaper and less hassle than finding, enrolling in, and paying for Korean classes at Maryland, I think I'll be taking advantage of this one in the near future. I'll keep you posted. 

Another reason I'm interested in this is that it will give me an opportunity to meet my own set of people--people who are not affiliated with SDA language institute or my church. Most likely I'll meet mostly foreigners, but I'm ok with that I guess. If a foreigner is paying bucks to learn the language, they'll probably have some Korean friends and plan on being around for a bit. 

Haunting!!!
Haunting is a big pastime of mine. I can't remember if I gave it this name or not, but it's basically just wandering around with no particular goal or destination in mind; it's all about the journey, not the endpoint. It's great for finding hidden gems or nice photos.

I haven't done it much since I've been here because of a few reasons. First, things open late here, so the morning is out. If I start to early, I have nowhere to stop in for a drink or something until 10 or 11, around the same time that the department stores open.

Second, afternoons leave me wandering around a sea of 아지마, with schoolkids plauging the early afternoon. Both ogle me mercilessly, which makes me the rare gem and my reason for haunting is totally taken from me. 

Third, night haunting (my favorite) is perfect but costly. I live outside of the downtown area and the subway in isn't scheduled to be operational till September. That leaves the buses (which stop around 10) and the taxis (which raise prices around 10). 

Even so, I like this pastime enough to try and see it through. Plus it will be very helpful for finding items to place on my supermap. I'll have to figure out which time is least inconvenient.

Silicon Valley's hating; what's new? 

Bill Gates is everyone's role model but Microsoft is the company that everyone loves to trash. Now Google looks like the new contender to the top spot, and all of a sudden the natives are restless again. Google's better than Microsoft ever was, or Google's more evil than Microsoft ever was--which is it?

There's a guy in Greek mythology named Sisyphus who really isn't relevant to this topic. However, he was banished by the gods to the underworld where his punishment was to push a heavy boulder up a steep hill. Upon completion, the boulder would, by its own weight, roll back down to the bottom. Rinse and Repeat.

This fate has often been used as a reference to futile and endless tasks we take on. And rather then a punishment for a wily man, it's viewed one man taking on an impossible task in hopes of success. This idea strikes home to a lot of starry-eyed geeks. Even to me, sometimes.

Problem is, <a href="http://www.mythweb.com/encyc/entries/sisyphus.html">Sisyphus' story</a> is not one of success. And while the valley wallows in sisyphanaticism it ignores the other side of the proverbial hill. 

The other side of the hill, if Sisyphus could ever reach it, would be a totally different environment; one where things move relatively quickly and succesfully. One where momentum builds and anything in your way gets steamrolled. One where <em>trying to stop the boulder</em> is now an exercise in futility.

I'm reminded of this when reading the comments in this article. Many people who rooted for  the underdog now rue it's bountiful existence.  My suggestion? Stop hating.

Don't hate the player, hate the game. It's a nasty hardcore world; there has to be big players and casualties. Think of it like God Emperor of Dune--there has to be a big, seemingly invincible monstrosity in order to create something to destroy the monopolistic rule of the behemoth.

So stop your pansy sisyphanatic whining and do  what Google did. That is unless you like eternal suffering....

BODY:
Because Daegu has been good to me, I decided to return the favor. If you've ever looked up information on Daegu (which I'm sure you haven't) you'd have run across <a title="The Daegu Guide - A Multimedia Guide to Life in Daegu Korea" href="http://thedaeguguide.com/">The Daegu Guide</a>--a once-useful now-outdated website with tons of information of varying current value.

I felt bad about the state of the site since so many people cross it's threshold, so I dropped an email asking how I could help. A few online conversations later, I held the keys to the site, given to me by the site's host, manager of KoreaBridge.

At first I worked feverishly on a unique and fashionable design, but then I started reading some web design workflow books and decided to take a different approach. Rather than making a Daegu Guide 2.0, why not start with a version 1.1? There's enough to divide into a few different upgrades, and then I don't need to worry about alienating the faithful few who are still checking the site with any reguarity.

First on the list (even before the purple background) was the frames. Oh good heavens lets be done with that. Combining the pages into one allowed for the use of layers, which naturally lends itself to CSS styling. I created a site that looked strikingly similar, yet was a big step towards my grand design.

I actually was hoping to share the test area with a few people last week, but disaster struck. Due to some iBook issues that cropped up while I was file transferring with Dreamweaver, I managed to erase the index page both on the server and on my machine. Back to square one.

Almost. Since I did everything in CSS, the structure is still there....I just gotta pull the content out of my butt again.

So....maybe in a week or two you'll be seeing a positive update to this post. Yet another project seeing progress. I don't feel like I'm going fast enough, but I'd rather be consistent that quick.

I understand the principle of a <a title="TrackBack - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback">TrackBack</a>, but they have little to no relevance to me on my site. In fact, they've become more than a slight nusiance.

On monday I deleted 89 trackbacks from Leftsider. Today, wednesday, I deleted 50. These trackbacks had descriptions and links that made my stomach turn. I mean really; I had to stop eating after clearing that crap out.

What good is a trackback? Especially if you're not frequently read, it's just an opportunity for misuse. Someone please tell me why I should let this madness continue.

I been reading this gut a lot, and I have to say when he's good, he's darn good. From the profile picture he looks like this guy I went to elementary school with name Lamont Johnson. But there's no way that guy got that smart. He's probably still in Delaware somewhere, in dire need of this article. And so for you, Lamont--and everyone else who hasn't assimilated yet--I make this post.

Better start thinking about it, because that may be where we're headed next.

When we were on the subway in Busan, we were followed by a group of schoolgirls, who were kinda cute in a funny way.

They went past their stop just to figure out how to ask me for my email (written on paper in English). Now I've got a comment on the last post, but I'm not sure which girl it is....comment again and let me know!</p>

I think that to truly understand this it's important to have had a real experience with asian culture. A lot of people will write this off as a western-styled insight to the flaws of a public system. Instead this is a real revelation of asian character.

I no other place have I seen more persistence and determination to survive. At first it seems like bravado or machismo--and perhaps it was at first--but with a whole society thinking this way, it transforms into an unbreakable platform of self-preservation that gives a person a sense of being; a real reason to live and live purposefully.

In western societies, it'd be common to find someone in a similar situation spending lots and lots of time focusing on the faults of the system and bemoaning his fate. Not much time, however, would be spent in making a plan. Maybe he'd watch his life crumble around him, helpless. Or maybe she'd bounce from residence to residence with no real plan for the future.

This guy obviously spent considerable time weighing his options, researching, and preparing a strategy. Why? because he relies on his own self for his success; a classic eastern viewpoint. He also has surprisingly low goals: a place for shelter, something he can afford. It shows that living acceptably in Japan and in the US are vastly different.

I was so confused when I first arrived in Korea and saw so many small stores--selling the same thing, no unique factors, even owners sleeping in chairs. Over time I came to recognize that working for  one's self symbolizes a certain level of freedom, even if that freedom means you are relegated to living in your office space. It's a sacrifice that many have deemed acceptable.

I hope that from my time in the east I learn to apply some of these principles to my own outlook on life. Focusing on the reality rather than bemoaning my dreams, I hope to be as soberly responsible when faced with adversity.

TAN keeps it hot; so when he says holla back I gotta represent.

I felt a need to respond since my meager spike received a spike in new visitors (4) who were searching either Google or Technorati for "assimilated negro." Guess trackbacks really do work; thanks for the blog contact high, yo.

If you're interested, a letter I just sent to Jim Pharo.

Jim is the father of my roomate, Joey, who died a week after we left. Jim is dying from cancer.
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
Two days ago I happened to be going through some archived conversations and happened across my last conversations from Joey's computer. It was from you and while we were all in bit of a daze, you were doing well: recovering from the hernia operation and happy that there  was regression in the situation with your tongue. I sent a little prayer that things were still ok.

Last night I was told that the issues with your tounge had returned, and that you aren't doing so well. It really hurts to imagine that, even though I know you're a fighter and not one to complain. My friend Cesar told me that Jo had headed down to be with you guys because of your condition, so I know it must be serious.

I never know what to say to anyone for the last time. I guess my problem is that I never want things to end, so I prefer to imagine them as paused. It would seem that I'm fooling myself; these days things disappear so fast and while I'm so far away. I feel a need to pay respects but my heart doesn't want to accept that perhaps this is my final opportunity.

Jim, you've been nothing but admirable to me. I can't say that I know you completely, but you have always shown a patience, intelligence and wit that I have been impressed by. Joey inherited your stubborn kindness; it was one of his most endearing qualities. And he looked up to you, so I do as well.

None of us can control this world, it's effects, or the way it effects us. If we could I'd imagine we'd live as 20 year-olds forever. :) But one thing we do know is He who is more than even time itself. He guarantees that I will see you again--be it in GA, MD, or heaven. I hope to meet you in the latter, with Joey, and catch up on all the things we missed.

My prayers and best wishes to you and your family. May God continue to be in your lives so that we will never truly be apart.

Always,

Bryan

If you've had a recent conversation with me....that narrows you down to about 3 people....you know I'm really passionate these days about giving opportunities to those less advantaged. I have a soft spot in my heart for those who don't even have the tools to dream.

That being said, this and the $100 computer really make me excited. And yes, the first commenter says what I really hope will happen. I can't wait to see some little illiterate einstein totally blow our minds away once he gets his hands on something new. 

Prolly crappy by my standard, but it's better than nothing. And that's a good place to start.

Using a wiki to find something I don't know? I've been doing it for a while and have found it very useful.

Using a wiki as a reference in an assignment? I was a little leary at first, but these days it's a real, valid resource.

Now Kottke shows me another excellent use for wikis--travel planning. First time I using TravelWiki but it gave me great info for the trip I'm currently planning, our Christmas vacation to <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Singapore">Singapore</a> and <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Kuala_Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a>*.


*Yes. Philippines has been officially removed from our Christmas plans. We have friends there (sorry!) but Frulwinn's parents were successful in making us question our personal security. So we're going somewhere with relatively lower chance of harm.

BODY:
This morning is the second morning that <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/whenblah/">Frulwinn</a> came running with me. There are a couple reasons why I think this is fantastic--and worth reporting.

The first and most pertinent reason is that Fru loves sleep. Love is not an overstatement here. On more than one occasion we have discussed her affinity for sleep and whether or not it rivals her affinity for me, her husband. I go to run around 5:30 in the morning, and that means a serious sacrifice on her part. For that alone, I'm impressed.

Another thing is that she's a bad runner. I'm a par runner, but I'm a great pacesetter; that's bad for a bad runner. We tried running together before back in Berwyn Heights but the hilly terrain had me practically running circles around her. This time, on a simple flat course, I started from the very beginning pointing out important techniques and she complied with real sincerity.

This second run I could see so much improvement. I'm still practically running in place on her behalf, but she has almost completely adopted my tempo (which I did not alter). This means that now all we have to do is stretch out her stride and she's ready to run*.

Frulwinn is a real athlete, for more capable of these things than I am. I wince a little when I see her adopt new things and develop skill so rapidly. But I'm happy to see her progress as a progress of my own. And I'm eager to find a reason to play catch-up. 


*As opposed to jogging, which I friggin' hate.

Well, it sounded like a good idea* until I read the comments. Maybe it's possible that the two Koreas will never reunite? A sad but realistic scenario.

Young Koreans are wizards when it comes to texting(texting in 한굴 is tons easier as well) and it shows in their speaking.

But is the understanding of efficiency-induced contractions completely absorbed? Here I am writing an entire post about this because leaving a trackback would take the same amount of time as signing up for his commenting system. Go fig.

Either way, other posts have helped to remind me that I could be doing something more constructive, like <a href="http://aboutjoel.com/blog/wp-trackback.php?p=429">putting my newfound language into practice</a>.

Watching an outdated public service announcement this morning on MTV Korea, I started thinking about the environment. Yeah. I don't know what that was all about either.

As long as we are makin' babies, we're going to be using more and more natural resources and taking up more space, right? Is that the way it has to go--absorb and sprawl? Living here in Korea has me rethinking that. Maybe there's another way.

Ninety-nine percent of the people that I've met in Korea do not have a yard. I've met some poor people (who generally live off the land more), a few rich people (who tend to have more expansive living habits), and a whole bunch of people in the middle. Only one couple out of all of them have land for actual landscaping, and they're dreadfully embarrased about it (I haven't actually seen it). 

It makes sense. In a country that is around 70% mountainous, inhabitable space is at a premium. Having large unused areas of land insinuates a kind of decadence (an insinuation that is untrue in that couple's case). You don't have land and not use it; it's not efficient or economical. Rather than spreading out, the housing schemes mimic the mountains themselves--going up instead of out. Is this something that we can develop on a global scale?

I'm just thinking briefly here; would it be feasible to start redesigning our cities to accomodate larger amounts of people in smaller spaces? From the living room window, I can see the homes of easily 5,000 people, with additional accomodations for at least half that in construction. 

Some of these apartments aren't that great, but some of them are absolutely fantastic. The new ones are top scale and easily surpass half-million dollar investments. At the base of the mammoth units are restuarants, services, educational institutes, grocers, and small shopping centers. People move in and out using freight elevators or trucks that have an lift-like ladder to unload furniture and items through the balcony window.

It's really nice when you become accustomed to it. It'll be hard for me to go back to the dream of a house and a backyard for a daily life option. I'd rather free up land for beautification of our world, for farmland, for wildlife protection. I feel like a homeland hippie now; I think I'm going to take a shower.

I don't know what I did or how long I've been doing it, but my butt has started itching progressively for the past few days. Today I did my business only to exit the bathroom feeling like I wiped with fiberglass. A feeling like never before.

I hope now that a Korean has said it some people will actually take this to heart. Koreans are extremely resourceful and hardworking, but there are a few more ingredients necessary to play in the international game.

Oh man this is great. I don't know what makes me like this piece more:
<li>Whites in the minority underachiever role</li>
<li>Whites worried that their child is focusing on test scores more than sports and optional activities</li>
<li>Whites looking for schools witt LOWER test scores</li>

Seriously, the thing just keeps getting better. I gotta say that I love this. 

I have a hard time understanding a logic that condems parents for pushing their kids to be academically stellar--even when they push too hard--yet still looks down on families who don't guide and direct their kids to be responsible and assertive. Where exactly do you stand?

While we're on things I'll regret when I return to the States. Um, hate to rain on your parade, but here in Korea I can charge my (korean)Motorola with almost any charger.

Mas, I can run into many convenience stores and get a quick 10 minute charge when my battery dies. For a small fee, of course, but when you need the call....

This is the second post today where I feel like responding to Gizmodo. I now realize; I need to be a commenter. Anyone have an invite?

This is a pretty good idea! I think I can see a better use for it though...

I can totally see this bringing usefulness to these lcd screens they keep trying to implement on new refrigerators. I open the door, look for what I have, and then the refigerator makes suggestions regarding creatable meals. Now that's useful!

Businesswo-mom comes home from a hard day and now can have a quick list of fast recipies. Bachelorette Betty can impress her unexpected guest with a meal she "just whipped up with what was there." Bonus points for health-friendly indicators. 

Any other ideas?

BODY:
Last night I went on an impromptu pub crawl. Plans for dinner with some associates fell through, so I decided to pay a visit to a friend of mine who co-owns a bar. I hadn't seen him in a while, so I felt like it was a good opportunity to pay a visit.

Caught up with him, sat back, enjoyed my non-alcoholic cocktail (they know me well there) and enjoyed the environment. I found myself in conversation with a German-born Korean who teaches English here. We struck up a good rapport, and when he asked me to accompany him to another bar, I said, "why not?"

I'm interested in the nightlife scene because I made a map of downtown a while back that I've really been neglecting, mainly because I need to go out and find the places that are worth identifying. So when asked to check out another popular spot, I have to agree for purely academic purposes. heh.

Anway we went to a bar called Itaewon Crew Pub. This is amusing because the place in Seoul that is known for foreigners is called Itaewon. Sure enough, everyone here was expat or very expat-friendly. The music was all American rock and folk with a little hiphop thrown in for good measure. The area was laid out nicely and, except for a few odd quirks, made a pretty nice place.

I had a soda and played some pool with my new friend, Leo. He introduced me to some other foreigners and we struck up more interesting conversation.

Finally it was last call at ICP. Our two new associates, Chris and John, suggested we check out another bar called Commune. At this point, my plans for catching the last train home were long gone, so there was nothing to restrain me. Off we go.

Lonely Hearts Club Commune ("Commune" for short) was a basement bar that made me feel like I had just stepped out of Korea and into 1997 all over again. Kurt Cobain pictures on the walls, a guy on the mic singing barefoot to his acoustic guitar, and virtually no Koreans. Ok there were a few: The bartender, his friend who played busboy, and a handful who were either Gyopo or dating a foreigner. By that description, this was not a place I really wanted to be.

As it turns out, the barefoot strummer was a guy I met before who teaches English at Daegu Catholic University. I chatted with him for a bit after ordering a ginger ale and greeting the friends of my (now three) new associates. Then the bartender threw on an eclectic mix which included beach boys and van morrison as well as smashing pumpkins and chef(from South Park) as well as theivery corporation and portishead. I was quelled. Perhaps this wasn't a hippiefest after all.

Well after meeting a few more people, exchanging a few numbers and watching the crowds dwindle, it was time to move on. Chris and John called it a night, but Leo was still ready to go. We headed to Bubble, a happening nightclub, but I parted ways at the door. It was after 3am and my initial intention was to be home by 11.

While nervously overseeing my sleepy taxidriver's attentions, I thought about my night. It reminded me a lot of those days long ago when I used to slip out at night and just wander and explore. I've always said that I wanted to do that here, but I never have. There's always been some excuse to keep me--and now I see that perhaps being "kept" had created some unvalidated opinions in my mind, particulary toward the expat crowd.

Maybe I'll venture out again. I imagine that if I ever get a call from any of those people I met I'll head down again and see if last night's pleasant crawl was a unique thing. Or maybe I'll just make a night of it myself. We'll see.

Well since they are one of the two teams without Korean members that get airtime here, I've been watching this team a bit and I'm totally not surprised. Sucks to be Luxemburgo though. Scapegoat is a hard role to play.

The way I feel about it? It's the has-been team. Everyone loves the name--and names that make the roster: Beckham, Ronaldo, Carlos.  I personally like <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4250368.stm">Robinho</a> and hold him as an exception, but otherwise its a team full of aging stars. No coach can do anything about that.

BODY:
This weekend we headed up to Seoul, with a few associates in tow, for a company-sponsored Christmas program. We weren't exactly sure what to expect, but we made the best of it, making additional plans for Sunday in case Saturday night's event was a bust.

Almost every time we go to Seoul we meet up with Leo and Laura. Both work in the office which oversees expatriate employees and would technically be considered Frulwinn's superiors. Yet since our initial orientation week when we first arrived, we have basically interacted completely as friends; in fact my flickr has quite a few pictures of them spending weekends here with us. 

This week was of no exception. We met up with them after the long corporate function and watched movies at Leo's house. I had suggested watching "The House of Flying Daggers," but my selection was pre-empted by the popular consensus, "White Chicks." 

*sigh*

After the two movies ( I needed some type of redemption after that first movie so I pushed to watch a second) it was just past 3am. We dragged ourselves through the harsh Seoul wind to our guest house where we promptly passed out.

But this entry isn't a recap of our weekend. Actually I just wanted to give a good word. On the way up I received a call from Leo checking to see if we were coming and where we were. Then after the party we went to his house for fun and entertainment. The next morning, as I played ping pong with Miez and Rogan, he called again--and was there to play 20 minutes later.

Leo had business in Kwanju, but he adapted his schedule to accomodate us all the way to the subway where we parted ways (he to Yongsan station and us to Seoul sation). And once he was on his train, he called again to see if we were finding ourselves ok in Seoul still. That's a nice guy.

Every couple years or so, I run into a guy like this, and I often fail to truly appreciate their genuine friendship. No one ever calls me unless they want something--be it information, assistance, or just an ear to listen. So I'm always taken aback when someone takes interest for no apparent reason than that <em>they like me</em>. To me, it really is an interesting phenomenon.

So here's three cheers to Leo and friends without intentions. I think we all could use a few more of those in our lives.

The Korea Times : GNP Leader Clad in Unusual 'Combat Uniform' Again</a>

Yet another article today that floors me with a quote--this time one that is so utterly ridiculous it makes me wonder if I really should even bother with Korean media:

"As the opposition leader put on her pants before making crucial political decisions or facing significant events, Park’s trousers have been considered a symbol of her strong determination."

Her pants are a symbol of her determination. They even go so far as to call her dress slacks "battle gear." I don't kid.

BODY:
Today my friend Minjung (이민정) showed me her new phone.

The top of this LG phone has a huge screen, while the bottm has a scrunched keypad. On the back of the keypad is a <em>5.0 megapixel camera</em>. My stupid camera--an actual camera--has only 2.0. The bottom portion also spins so that you can see yourself on the big huge screen while you take your picture with the <em>5.0 megapixel camera</em>. 

Minjung currently doesn't know how to answer the phone, so you can be sure this isn't some technophile with the newest gadget. No, this is just life in Korea. When I get the model off her I'll update with pics.

Ah, this link makes me think of my dear departed roomate, Joseph Pharo. Joey did everything extreme: Eat a box of waffles, buy a 40" plasma TV <em>ten years ago</em>, use high quality Advent monitor speakers in his work cubicle....stuff like that. He'd drink a two liter of Dr. Pepper in one sitting (even though he was diabetic) and play video games without relent (THPS3 in two days, anyone?). We actually turned his name into a verb:

"Who Joeyed the popcorn?"

"Sorry man, I was watching the first two seasons of CSI straight and couldn't be bothered for dinner. I'll go to Costco tomorrow and buy a pallet!"

Then he would build computers. Computers for every one! And when he finally got around to building one for his own use, it was a scorcher. I remembering asking him, while he was installing the third hard drive--620gb total--"why?"

"I went on a tour of the FBI one time and they said they have a terrabyte (~1,000gigabytes) of information," he said with that glint in his eye. "So I need to have at least that much."

"And what are you going to do with all that space? And two channels of 2gb of RAM? And the <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2204,CONTENTID=10628">webcam</a> that looks like the <a href="http://www.popartuk.com/g/l/lgfp1167.jpg">eye of sauron</a>?"

Joey shrugged. "Surf, email, Kazaa, maybe webcam with some girls in Brazil." Money was no object; only capability.

Yes my pal would have loved this nearly $24,000 computer. He'd scoff at it at first, but soon enough he'd be working out pricing. If he was still around, our groceries would probably be ramen noodles and PBJ for the next month while he saved.

If I had the money, I'd most definitely buy this overpriced box o' bolts. And then, with a misty eye, I'd christen it <strong>The Joey</strong>.

You gotta listen when a guy gets all gushy about B. Frank, even if it's just for the humor value. Following the interesting tidbits, however is a decent presentation tied together fairly well. I just wish the sound quality was a little better.

Just now, and with little deliberation, I've decided to heretofore refer to my usual processes of trying new applications, mastering web techniques, learning new computer-related languages, dabbling in basic scripting and programming, figuring out computer software or hardware-related issues, web browsing and blogging as "scratching my nuts."

That was something I used to do quite often as a adolecent and high school student. It was an almost involuntary condition that happened on a constant basis--from when i first got up until I got back into bed. Sometimes it produed a pleasant satisfaction, while other times it had no effect at all. And, finally, people always gave me funny looks when i talked about it. 

Yeah. it's really quite similar. Any objections are welcome in the comments section.

Here's the Chinese SDA Church on Thomson Rd which we attended Saturday, Christmas Eve.

	Next to the church is the San Yu Adventist School. There were pictures in the church of staff and graduates of this school that went way back--so apparently it's a well-established  educational institution here. Middle and high school, as I'm aware.

	Christmas dinner was a onslaught of "firsts." First Christmas in hot weather, First Christmas in a country where Christianity is not the majority (so ALL stores were open! Sweet!), First time having pizza for the time-honored meal.....but all of the above were so good. <br />
<br />
Fru and I walked the strip and then made one of our favorite pizza joints, California Pizza Kitchen, our Christmas Dinner Finalist. Delicious.

	When I was in high school, I asked Frulwinn what her favorite flower was. She told me that she really liked orchids. Since then, I've always thought about her whenever I run across mention of these flowers.<br />
<br />
At the back of the Singapore Botanical is an Orchid Garden. In fact, I believe that it's the world's largest orchid garden. I made sure to put this on our list of things to do, hoping to see my wife swoon.<br />
<br />
As we entered the garden, I asked her, "Aren't orchids your favorite flower?"<br />
<br />
"No; Calla Lilies," she replied. "I think they're my mom's favorite though. She would love this." <br />
<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
I guess it's easy to see that time changes things. Oh well. <br />
<br />
The safari excited her, and she did say she enjoyed the orchid garden. But I've still got tricks up my sleeve....<br />
<br />
(btw, there's a ton of flower pics on flickr if you're interested. I tend to go crazy when in a garden with a camera.)

	After a wonderful garden tour I had planned to show my wife a wonderful view of Singapore and Malaysia as we made our way to Kuala Lumpur. But, as a bumbling procrastinator, I waited too long.<br />
<br />
When we arrived at the Malaysia Railway Station we were surprised to find that the tickets were all sold for the train to KL. Through a stroke of good fortune, however, we were able to get two tickets from another couple who were exchanging for another day.<br />
<br />
These were overnight seats, however. That means that the trainride was useless; the scenery was pitch black. The first class seating wasn't quite first class, either. <br />
<br />
Anyway, we made it--arriving 6am the next day. As always, my lovely wife just smiles. She was just happy that we got there. <br />
<br />
*sigh* Foiled again. I'm still not done though!

	KL used to be the capital but it has recently been moved down south a bit. Still, this is the place to be and see. <br />
<br />
After recoop'ing from the trip up, I took Fru down to the strip for a little shopping, then we went to the KL tower for a fantastic night view of the city.<br />
<br />
The tower staff fitted us with headphones and we were told all about what we were seeing....even if we weren't really interested in knowing exactly. Lasting just a second longer than it should've it kinda prevented any "ooh"s and "aah"s I would have observed from Fru. Drat. still very nice.<br />
<br />
Here you have a pic, from the tower, of the Petronas towers. These, until a few years ago, were the tallest structures in the world (incidentally, the KL Tower seems equally high due to being on a hill).

Because I've been <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/archives/2005/10/setbacks_where.htm">doing some work</a> and <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/archives/2005/08/mapmaking.htm">involving myself in projects</a> that have to deal with balancing improvements in aesthetic and usability, I find myself trying to apply the same principles to other areas. Here are two in particular.

<strong>The resume</strong>. In the span of my short life I've seen so much movement and progress. From ditto machines to e-paper. From pocket calculators to smartphones. From tables and forms to AJAX and stylesheets. Am I to believe that the CV has no opportunity for growth whatsoever?

Since I'll be needing to update my information anyway, I'm considering creating something from the ground up. But of course, this type of plan needs to be community driven and based on standards and issues rather than personal styles and agendas. I'd love to hear some thought on this.

<strong>Leftsider</strong>. Duh. I've been looking at certain sites and seeing what I'dd like to add and subtract. I want something similar but with a more friendly, more developed method. Plus, I've been procrastinating about the bad CSS in the archives long enough. heh.

I guess I'll be adding these things to my growing list of things to take care of....I wonder if cleaning my plate off by the end of the year is out of the question?

For a minute I wondered why reading this article made me so happy. It's been so long since I've been able to intelligently discuss what matters to me most in this situation.

Many of my friends oppose our involvement in Iraq. Still others have that very patriotic braggadocio that justifies our presence with a mildly swaggering air.

A lot of people that I've met in Korea have a distinct distaste for George Bush. They assert that he loves war, and that being in Iraq is unnecessary. I cannot confirm or deny any of these statements, but I think they are mostly grounded on what people see in the US media that is available to them. I'm sure the high number of America-wary Canadians about don't help the perception much.

But once upon a time, long ago, I felt a little spark of hope in this big, dark heart of mine. I envisioned a people who were free--not in actions or in business, but in philosophy and thought. I hoped that from the developing rubble an opportunity would arise where all people could feel free to embrace their beliefs and be part of a unified collective.

This article reveals that spark again. I'm so happy for the people of Iraq as the move toward their own collective vision of tomorrow--whatever it may be.

The Korea Times : 'Seoul Citizens Exposed to Highest Cancer Risk'</a>

Twenty-one out of every 1,000 Seoul citizens are likely to suffer from cancer during their life time, the highest risk of cancer among the nation's seven largest cities, due to environmental pollution, a government report said yesterday.

<strong>The southeastern city of Taegu had the second highest cancer risk caused by various environmental pollutants</strong> as 14.2 out of its 1,000 citizens are likely to contract cancer, followed by Ulsan with 4.7 and Inchon with 3.9.

Problem with being an early adopter is that you often forget about things you signed up for. Just ran across my old Ta-Da list and realized I've knocked out a good bit of them in my time here. Hopefully I can finish this list before it's all over with.

By the way, I did <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/frulwinn/49495245/in/set-379026/">rock a Yangban outfit</a>....does that count as a hanbok?

"It is worth taking a minute to look at the statistics, because they are truly amazing. China is the world's most populous country, with 1.3 billion people. 

On size alone, it is fast becoming a technology superpower and it almost has no choice in the matter. For example, even though only 8% of its people have access to the internet, this equates to 100 million people online, second only to the US."

I seriously am impressed by this guy. He's inspiring me to push a little harder these days. Who knows, maybe I will start a korean journal soon....I'm technically at that level in theory...

I agree with Torrez on this one.

Funny story. My first time ever using a personal computer. I had used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">commodores</a> at school for pacman and <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dr-j-and-larry-bird-go-one-on-one">Dr. J vs Larry Bird</a>, but never a computer for private use at home. Wow! The concept! The possibilities!

The object: A frankin(?) dual-floppy PC. If I remember correctly, 16kb of storage, tower style. My father's prized posession--and completely off limits to me and my sister.

Finally I found a reason to get on the machine: school report. Reluctantly, my father acquiesed. Now remember this was all an intricate plot; so I had ulterior motives in play. And that motive was....

Lisa Bonet. Yes she lit a fire in my gradeschool heart and I was determined to find out information on her. My father had put in WordPerfect for Dos (ha!) and, amazingly left me to my own devices. Now was my chance!

I typed: "Who is Lisa Bonet?"

Nothing happened. Darn! there must be more to this info-culling than I anticipated. I tried again. "Who is Lisa Bonet?"

Still nothing. Drat! Oh wait....I forgot to hit enter! Duh?

The sentence I wrote moved down a line. My heart leaped as I waited for information to pour onto the screen, telling me everything a preteen needs to know to win the heart of a 20-something hollywood firecracker. I hit enter a few more times for expidited posterity. 

"Are you almost done?" My father's voice snapped me out of my lull. Crap! I'm here waiting and haven't started writing this report! Ok. now to get this off the screen and start typing....

Somehow I managed to get back up to the top of the screen, but I couldn't figure out how to get down to my typed query,  smackdab in the middle of the screen. So, I kept pushing enter (or was it Return back then?). eventually, all I saw was blue screen. Sweet now let's start.

Imagine my father's joy when he comes to print my report. It went a little something like this:
<li>two blank pages</li>
<li>two pages of report</li>
<li>six blank pages</li>
<li>a page with "Lisa Bonet"</li>
<li>a pate with "Who is Lisa Bonet?"</li>

Remember, this is back in the day when printers were fed peforated piles of paper from a cardboard box. My dad was actually less than pleased.

This is one of the reasons I say that I was made for internet, and internet was made for me. People often wonder how I can work in an office on a computer all day and very happily spend an entire evening doing the same. Simple. I wanted answers from my computer since I was in elementary, and now I have them.

We live in the future. This is my kinda time.

A couple days ago I successfully upgraded the RAM in my iBook to its maximum, 1.25gb. I was really nervous about this, because I had never upgraded ram (ok maybe once) and never worked on laptop hardware. Since my iBook is my lifeline these days, I was very pensive.

Additionally, I used my bad korean speaking ability to order the RAM from a questionable Mac service center for a ridiculously low price. When I came back to pick up my order, the memory was givent to me, folded in a square of aluminum foil with a handwritten receipt. I was sure of impending doom, so I named the post iBotched--as in my botched attempt to upgrade my computer.

Surprisingly, though, everything when smoothly. Even though the numbers on my stick of RAM were far from identical to the ones listed in the recommendations in my manual, they were almost a match to the ones on the stick I was replacing. And the whole operation took a record 15 minutes--not including my going back to make sure I hadn't missed anything.

So I've decided to rename this operation iBump, in reference to both the bump up in speed and the mountain that I made out of a molehill.

I am an oddity in Korea on many levels. I'm a long-haired black man. I'm not from Africa, not in the military, and not an English teacher. Moreover, I came to Korea to study the language and culture and I'm having a really good time that has really enriched me. I promote Korea, especially Daegu, with a heartfelt fervor.

It's probably <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2005/11/pub_crawl.htm">already evident</a>, then, that I have <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2005/08/leftsider_the_hermit.htm">difficulties dealing with prolonged exposure</a> to foreigners here in Korea. This is especially true for those of us who come from the western hemisphere. Because I fall in that category, perhaps this is not the best thing to say. I hope you will recognize me as an exception to the rule; if not, let me know where <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2005/08/combating_stupidity.htm">I can change</a>.

The first and foremost issue that I have with foreigners is that often do not make an effort towards assimilation. So many people complain about things being "different," "weird," or "so 'Korean'," yet they fail to realize that they are the visiting strangers. If you are in Korea, expect things to be Korean. Why would they be like America? This is not America. I imagine these are the same people who, when in the US, would complain about people who don't speak English well.

The next thing could probably be considered 1.1: wallowing in misery. For every moaning foreigner, there are another four who have to listen to their story. Out of those four, one or two are quite possibly new to Korea and are receiving subconscious instruction to reciprocate this wheel of whining. This seems to be especially true of English teachers. Foreigners in Korea tend to disproportionately be in this category, so I don't know if my use of especially is really valid.

These two really are the meat of my rant, but there are a few other things that really irritate me. I can't for the life of me understand these horrible phenomena:

Foreign residents very rarely adopt the clothing styles of Korea. Instead, they adopt a "I bought this at Old Navy in 2001" look that becomes even more disheveled when brought into contact with Korean laundering. Why must we look so bummy? 

On that note, most foreign residents that I've met have been very slim or unhealthily overweight. I know that I lost about 15 pounds in my time here (much of which has been regained) so being slimmer is understandable. Being unhealthy, either slim or otherwise, is not. Well being is everywhere in korea. Western medicine, eastern medicine, health spas, skincare centers, yoga everywhere you look....it really would be in your greater interest to channel that disparaging energy you're pining away from towards something that will be beneficial to your life. Like learning to cook and making a little physical exertion here or there.

Ok the next one may not actually be your fault: you're often not very academic. I'm saying it nicely; I have a hard time seeing many foreign teachers holding a similar or applicable position in their home country. That is your fault, but the fact that all of you happened to gravitate here may be Korea's fault more than anything. As it stands, I feel I have lost most of my intellectual conversation skills due to compromising for learning Koreans and dim expats. Just this week some Koreans bashfully asked me why their teachers so often misspelled words--a rarity in Korea. I covered you by noting the Korean language's anchoring to meanings held in Hanja and such which don't exist in english words. But be sure, this employment-unfit student wonders the same thing sometimes.

Finally, culture. Ok so most of us are from the US and Canada, but are we really all the same? Foreign residents, in my humble opinion, leave no incentive to the Korean population to develop a heterogeneous society. All foreigners seem to do is dress bad, act sullen, and drink in designated venues (Some might also add "steal our women," but I haven't lost my wife to theft so I'm going to leave that one alone. Ha). No book clubs,  no forums, no community awareness initiatives or anything. Maybe I was spoiled coming from the DC metro area. A quick scan of our closest married friends confirms that, actually: White married to Korean, Panamanian married to White, Israeli-South African married to Jewish-South African, Filipino, Dominican, Japanese....ok I'm privileged but that doesn't mean we can't have any diversity here.

Perhaps this chastisement does come a bit unannounced; I apologize. But for the last two weekends I have been trapped in situations where I was  trapped with these glaring annoyances. I get frustrated when I'm pigeonholed with people of this ilk, and you know that Leftsider is my place to vent.  Rant off.

Hey Bryan

I'm in Daegu and I'm not one of those bar-clutching dimwits you're talking about. I'm sure there are quite a few people about who want more out of life than beers and moans, we just don't know how to get together.
I'm trying to start a writer's group which could also be a book group. Get in touch if you're interested. (I'm a little chubby right now so I'm little nervous about sending you this invitation - be gentle ok? ;->)

Hey Rachel

I'm quite sure that there are exceptions to my (very loose) rule so I'm more than willing to grant your difference. As far as getting together, I'd instead recommend spreading out as far as you can--and then being the bridges that connect the general population to the general foreigner mass.

I'm not much of a writer, and my reading choices these days are decidedly academic, but if you're looking to pull something together I may have a solution that would befit us both. I'll be in touch.

Hiya, 

This really is a very thoughtful post and as a gyopyo, echoed my sentiments exactly.  

When I first saw your photos, I thought exactly what you said: you are an anomoly (to put it politely) In South Korea so I marvelled at the way you and your wife seem to have carved out a true place for yourself in the society, accepting the good and the bad, in a way that mirrors my experience in Canada and Australia.  Similar complaints to those you mention from foreigners in Korea would be shot down so quickly in the West with ideas of how immediately "indebted" they are to their new country.

I am not religious and probably never will believe in a Christian God.  In my own state of bigotry,  tarred all Christians with the "you're so insular" brush.  It would seem that part of the reason you've been able to insinuate yourself so successfully is *because* of the network your church gives you.  Kudos. 

I've been humbled by your humility and grace. 

Oblivia

Undoubtedly, my church network has helped so much. I think that, also, my work with my denomination has given me a little more willingness to understand the other guy. And the opportunities for international travel really helped.

I'd like to think I could live anywhere; I don't know if I'm fooling myself with that notion or not.

The Korea Times : Foreign Demand for Korean Language Teachers Rising</a>

Good article but I disagree with the opinions viewed at the bottom. What the Korean language needs is exposure; and the format that Koreans use for English is not ideal--it reinforces bad habits that are difficult for native teachers to correct, years later.

I find this VERY questionable for numerous reasons. I'll leave it up to you to make your own opinion. Interesting to note, however:

"Females accounted for more than 90 percent of foreign spouses, with 54,533, due to the increasing number of marriages between Korean males and women from Southeast Asian countries that are arranged by marriage agencies."

So much for the "stealing our women" argument. That actually suprised me.

This makes me very sad. Wikipedia is a perfectly good example of what the web can do. What's happening now is a perfectly good example why the web really can't do all it's capable of. And, of course, the media gives it loads of attention when it's in its not at its best.

	Perhaps you know by now that I was all about pleasing the Mrs. on this trip. We had a really nice hotel, but when they got sketchy on the internet provisions I seized the moment and decided to check if anything else good was available. As a result, we got to spend the night in a five-star hotel.<br />
<br />
The Mandarin Oriental KL is no joke. It was Fru's first time staying in a 5-star (it was mine, as well, but you know I have appearances to upkeep so I was decidedly ho-hum about the whole thing) and they really impressed her. This kinda worried me because even she noted that our trip was just getting better and better....could I keep up the pace?<br />

	Next we went on a tour which, unbeknownst to me, included feeding monkeys with food we had to purchase. I failed to see the novelty, but I think Frulwinn was amused.<br />
<br />
Growing up in the country, I fed animals. Pets and stuff. But I knew a lot of people who also fed animals. Cows, chickens, pigs, horses, whatever. So feeding an animal just is lost on me. Sorry. Next slide!

	After feeding monkeys, it was decided that we should feed ourselves. <br />
<br />
Our tour companions were from Holland and Russia (Siberia!). They were quite friendly, but the fact that we all had our native tongues and our spouses with us limited group conversation somewhat. Luckily there was plenty of food to stuff our empty mouths with. <br />
<br />
After eating, we went to another part of the river you see behind us. We all were here just for this moment...

	If you were in the boat with us, looking where I took this picture, you would have seen THOUSANDS of fireflies flashing, making the trees along the water blink like christmas trees. Apparently, the all stopped bllinking when the shutter opened. <br />
<br />
Kidding; though I do wonder what it would take to capture something like that in a picture.<br />
<br />
Frulwinn said she liked it. She spent most of the time worried that the mosquitos were going to bite her ankles, though. *sigh*

	For my finishing act, I chose to make our last hotel very contemporary and stylish--for the designer in Fru. We stayed in Le Meridian Changi Village, a four star, for roughly $75 a night.<br />
<br />
Very trendy place with a nice layout, rooftop pool, and far away from the hustle of the city. With great aesthetics and peaceful surroundings, I thought this would be the best way to bring Fru's vacation to a rejuvenating end.

<p class="flickr-yourcomment">
	After a day of downtime it was New Year's Eve! What to do, what to do??? I had an idea to go to Sentosa Island, and the fact that there were ads everywhere about the Sentosa celebrations made my tentative plan a little more concrete.<br />
<br />
Then I talked to an online pal who lives in S'pore and they mentioned that Ministry of Sound (if you don't know, I can't explain) had opened a venue in Clark Quay just a few weeks before. Being the music/dancing freak that I am, all logic went out the window and I was determined this was the best place to spend NYE.<br />
<br />
It probably would have been. However, a couple thousand other people had the same idea. New years came with us about 1/3 of the way through the queue, and we didn't get in until nearly 2am. Even so it was a blast--easily the best party I've ever been to--and we had a lot of fun until we dragged ourselves into our room around 6am.<br />
<br />
After another day of downtime, we headed out to Sentosa. Immediately I recognized the error in my ways: MoS was great for clubbing, but Sentosa would have been FANTASTIC for NYE. The place is laid out very nice with lots of beautiful things to do and see (check the pics in Flickr). I felt kinda selfish and bad after this realization.<br />
<br />
Anyway Sentosa was beautiful with Merlion, the city mascot, watching over us all as we wandered about.

	Sentosa had beach and touristy attractions, but some parts made me feel like I had just stepped into an Indiana Jones movie. Just waiting for a giant snake to fall on us as we're being chased by natives.<br />
<br />
Granted if the natives of singapore were chasing us, you'd definitely see their tribal markings of fantastic highlights in their hair as they brandished their moblie phones and Vuitton bags. This is both the male and female native, btw. :)

	One day you're on a touristy jungle island in a t-shirt, and the next day you're in a concrete jungle subway, fully clothed and bundled. Alas, there's nothing really we could do about it. We had to come home sometime.<br />
<br />
So we're back. And seeing that bright smile made it through the travel back (and even still is shining today!) makes me feel good. Perhaps my vacation planning was a success after all. I hope so; I sure did try.<br />
<br />
Thus ends the vacation coverage. You can always see more in my flickr pics, and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/frulwinn/">Fru is adding pics to her flickr as well</a>. <br />
<br />
Now back to your boring, graphically sparse, regularly scheduled programming. heh.

More and more I'm starting to agree with slapping offenders with a strong reprove. Yes it's ridiculous, but it can totally be avoided by proper conduct.

I'm especially fond of this after my time in Singapore, perhaps one of the most fine-happy countries on the planet.

People in US ask me regularly if I'm excited to be returning. Koreans wonder why foreigners are so eager to go home. I look at this story, and I truly don't know. Moreover, I'm not used to that anymore; I've lived in peace for the last year.

I'm so no ready to return to the US if this is what I'll get.

Oh my goofy gulai I want one of these. Lately I've been doing a lot of reading digitally....mostly technical books but occasionally something of interest to most of you. I've become accustomed to using my pda (sideways, in landscape view), but this would be exponentially better.

The only thing that would make it better, which I doubt will ever happen, would be if it supported CHM files.

크리스마스방학도안에 싱아풀에 내 안경을 잊었다. 실제로 그것은 처방약 것 안이었지만 안경들은 보통좋갰다. 새로운 안경을 사기로 한기 때문이다. 

오눌에 시내로 갔어 안경쇼핑을 하기로했다. 이시간데 그것들은 싸기때문에 두개를 살다. 그래서 나는 행복 하고 스타일이쉬를 이다!

During Christmas vacation I forgot my glasses in Singapore. Actually, they're not prescription, but I like glasses in general. So I decided to buy a new pair.

Today I went downtown, so I decided to do some eyeglass shopping. This time, they were much cheaper, so I bought two pair. The two together cost about $50. Therefore, I'm happy and stylish!

Cute article. I hate to be the party pooper, but it's "the birds and the bees and the flowers in the trees." So what birds and bees do to each other is not even a question; the question is do they know that they both hittin' the flowers in the trees? Cause that's drama just waiting to happen...

Gus Speth, dean of the Yale school of Forestry and Environmental studies, warned that America's performance, ranked 28th, was of global concern. "The lagging performance of the US on environmental issues, particularly on energy and climate change, signals trouble not only for the American people, but for the whole world."

Canadians see the United States as consumed with war, weighed down with massive and growing national debt and divided by intolerance. Recent polls have shown deep antipathy among Canadians toward the Bush administration and general anti-Americanism.

Misfortune has brought the churning wheels of Leftsider weblinking to a screeching halt. 

I'm trying to start a local web development environment, so I wiped my iBook clean and reinstalled OS X (a nasty Windows habit). But the backup application that I used didn't save my newsreader preferences.....and didn't export my subscriptions. Why would I export my subcriptions when I'm supposedly backing up the entire hard drive?

So there are no sites in my reader now. I'm taking as an opportunity to try out the <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a>; we'll see how that turns out.  In the meantime,  you may be forced to sit through my banter. *shudder*

For those of you watching Apple's switch to Intel, here's an interesting comparison chart for you.

I'm still up in the air about the whole thing. I'm itching to get back to the US and get reacquainted with XP,  but if I can buy a new Apple that runs both......why? I don't hate Apple, and actually I've become rather used to it, using for the last 14 months. 

Perhaps this is what Apple had in mind when they planned this whole thing. They're not out to make people hate PC (though there are legions of fanboys who do)-- they just figure if you had a totally open choice to do both, would you really still choose as you do now?

I think it's a smart mentality; I'm nearly sold. ;)

Singapore (my new "it" country) beat the United States in this ranking of the world's best. It just missed the top 10. South Korea was way down at position 30....but actually beat Costa Rica(35). What is that??? Mexico and Chile did as well. Hmm.

Anyway, as I haven't spent extended time in Europe, I'm interested in finding out what's so nice about Ireland. Switzerland, sure; but Ireland? Go fig. I guess I'll never know until I visit...

So I guess this post is long overdue.

Fru and I are going back to the US in March. We'll say goodbye to Korea on March 4, spend a few days in Japan, then arrive in the states on the 8th. Our time living in Asia will, at that point, have ended. 

I know that it's a necessary move. Frulwinn is tired of teaching English; I need to return to employia and continue my academic pursuits. It has always been an element of the plan; so why do I feel reservation about it?

Initially, I assumed it was because of a socio-cultural void. Everyone and everything we've experience in the last year will be unknown, and everything in that same period that has happened stateside for our families, friends, and communities doesn't exist to us. People have children that didn't exist before. People who I know are now dead--so many, in fact, that I'm not sure I remember everyone who has died. No concept of superbowls or judge confirmations. And no one there has perspective on APEC, Hwang Woo-suk, Yaksuni, or X-맨. For the first time, I get a more realistic idea of what it'd actually be like for a person to step in and out of an alternate dimension (like all those X-men comic books I read as a youth).

But, more recently, I've started to realize an even deeper tie. When Fru and I return, we'll be leaving a place that we lived for 14 months. Not that long. I lived with Joey in Silver Spring, however, for only 16 months. That experience impacted me in many ways that I'm likely to never forget it. In the same way, the things that I left and was separated from, the things which I may never see or experience again, and everything else hangs right here in Daegu. Sits and watches me pack up and leave.

Daegu has become as much of a home as any other place I've lived in. So naturally when I leave my home, my friends, my special places and my familiarities behind....well, I lose quite a bit. This doesn't change just because I'm moving back to something more familiar.

So...time keeps going faster and I'm procrastinating again--my trivial hope that if I accomplish nothing, nothing will change. But they will.

I'm preparing to say goodbye, Daegu. Please be gentle; breaking up is hard to do.

For the last 45 minutes or so, Frulwinn has been sitting next to me thinking up ideas for her resume re-design. She's been playing around with a lowercase, serifed, italicized "f" as a logo and theme for the project.

Everything she has come up with is pure genius. Sofar, I've seen about five progessing versions that I would have totally stopped and worked with. Yet she keeps going. And it keeps getting better. Occasionally she'll reference the Illustrator helpfile or an online tutorial for information on doing a certain technique, but the idea is all hers, and she just keeps going.

People with talent disgust me, a no-talent hack.

A couple weeks ago I went to the bookstore with a friend and ended up buying a book that looks pretty interesting. <a title="Let's Learn Korean - Learn Hanja the Fun Way" href="http://letslearnkorean.com/index.php/korean/comments/learn-hanja-the-fun-way/">Learn Hanja the Fun Way</a> takes an interesting approach to learning the Hanja (Chinese characters) upon which 70% of korean vocabulary is based. Probably not the best place to start your korean study, but definitely good if you're looking for stronger grasp on vocab and/or branching to japanese or chinese later.

I personally was sold on it because it was written by someone born and raised attended 경북대 right here in Daegu, but it seems that it has gotten favorable reviews.

SubEthaEdit is targeted at developers who embrace agile programming methods, specifically the pair-programming facet of eXtreme Programming.  The idea is that keeping maintainable source code requires a lot of peer review.  And instead of having periodic developer meetings reviewing changes made by the entire team since the last meeting, programmers are paired off and they write code, read each other's code, and talk about code together.  Thus, peer review happens all the time as the code is being written.  A collaborative editor like SubEthaEdit lets programmers that aren't physically in the same location practice pair-programming.

Since I've been recently shown some blog love by none other than <a href="http://theassimilatednegro.blogspot.com/2006/02/and-i-heard-em-say-sex-is-never.html">Mr. TAN himself</a>, I've decided to pull out one that I've been sitting on for a while. About a month ago, over some trivial and triffling thing, I whimsically uttered, "Just like black people." The problem is, I wasn't talking about blacks; I was talking about Koreans.

Immediately <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/whenblah/">my wife</a> and my friend Robert questioned me about my rationale. We all live in Korea, and it's nothing at all like being at home. But being one who refuses to back down easily, I argued my case--much to their amusement. And so, today, I present to you a few things that Koreans and black Americans seem to share.

<ol><li><strong>Things.</strong> Haha I know that's painfully faceless, but work with me. As I study Korean and Korean culture, I'm always encountering people who write things off as only understood by Koreans. It's kinda ridiculous when you spend most of your day looking at Korean customs and traditions--of course you know about it, then--but someone will insist: "It's just a part of our culture; it won't make sense but that's how it is." So reminiscent of "<a href="http://www.itsablackthang.com/">It's a black thing</a>; you wouldn't understand."</li>
<li><strong>Home Cooking. </strong>Somewhat related to the first, Koreans are especially fond of traditional meals. Come to Korea, and someone will shortly invite you to a traditional meal--just like mom used to make. Problem is, most of the time it'll be to a restaurant; these home cooked meals are becoming more and more of a rarity in modern living.
I grew up in a more rural area, so I've had my share of down home cookin'. And we love to reminisce of its virtues, swearing it the best, illogically healthy, and even a source of strength and virility. Yeah; it's just like that here in Korea.</li>
<li><strong>Percussional Proclivity. </strong>Parade? Holiday? Traditional celebration? Bring out the drums. Jumping around and dancin' the fool to nothing but drums and cymbals once meant that I was attending a <a href="http://www.collegeview.com/articles/CV/hbcu/halftime_dreams.html">HBCU competition</a>. Today it means some Korean is keeping it real. Oratorical history is usually perfomed with a drum as well.</li>
<li><strong>Hustlin'. </strong>This was the original point of contention. To be more polite to both sides, I will formally call it "entrepreneurial creativity and unconventional resourcefulness." From getting things done cheap to making a profit where there is none, both black Americans and Koreans can be matchless geniuses. Can be; doesn't mean they always are.</li>
<li><strong>Pride.</strong> When it comes down to it, no one loves you more than you love yourself. Both Koreans and black Americans know this all to well. Forced servitude and the general "raw deal" are in both histories. So is emancipation and revitalization. Now, it seems, we both spend a lot of our time validating ourselves to the world at large.</li></ol>

Ok so there are a few. Hope this is helpful to you, though I can imagine how. Maybe it can be a bridge between black and korean americans? No....<a href="http://asiapages.typepad.com/the_asia_pages/2006/02/gyopos_and_kore.html">Jodi says koreans and gyopos are too different</a>. Hmm. Maybe the secret for <a href="http://lostnomad.blogs.com/the_lost_nomad/2006/02/the_la_times_on.html">Ward Hines' success</a>? Maybe not. If you do find it useful, kindly let me know. See any points I missed? Share them, would you?

Man, if the kids I met were this funny, I'd like kids a lot more. It's interesting to note that their opinions really reflected thought, rather than the short attention span and impatience that I usually associate with kids that age.

Yet another reason why I'm having reservations about my re-entry into north american culture. What kind of loser would do this?
Page has been getting a lot of publicity around the blogosphere, so I'd be surprised if the people aren't eventually shamed into doing  the right thing.

So there's this "Four Things" meme going around and it's really pissing me off.

"Why?" you may ask. Well, for various reasons. The first and initial reason is that I dislike having to read through all that mess, and then after you're done you have to clear the last person's answers and fill the dumb thing out. This was old back when I used to get them every week (weak!) when I was using Hotmail. It's mad old now.

But then, <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/01/30/four_things">all</a> the <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2006/01/four_things.html">cool kids</a> are <a href="http://www.megnut.com/2006/01/my-four-things">doing it</a> in <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/01/four-things">spades</a>. Big names; hotshots. So I desperately want to do it to associate with greatness. But to truly use the meme correctly it must be passed to you.....and who's going to pass to me? <a href="http://rabiddustbunnies.blogspot.com/">Ed</a>? Yeah, ok.

Once I realize the futility of ever being a part of this wildly popular meme that I will grumble about doing, I realize that I'd be a dead end anyway. Who to pass to? <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/whenblah/">Fru</a>? <a href="http://kymjoi.blogspot.com/">Kim</a>? it's depressing. 

So there. That's why I'm peeved. I'm going to mope now.

Vaseline’s first major success came as medicine, which is ironic because later it was proved to have no curative power whatsoever—the only advantage to its use was the fact it kept grime and bacteria out of the injuries.

	A gentle reminder that much of black history....isn't actually history yet. Still a lot of hunger, starvation, oppression, miseducation, forced servitude and violence.<br />

If you don't agree, is 2006 the year that black history o0fficially stops at the slave boats? That's ok with me......<a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/02/sex_addict_kanye_struggles_wit.htm">Kanye and I are ready to fill in any void that is left by the schism</a>.

To many Americans, eyebrows raise at the very idea of suicide bombers believing their heavenly reward will include sex with beautiful virgins. But aren't the 75 percent of Americans who believe in an afterlife concerned that there might not be any sex in their heaven?

Lately I've found myself having a small knot of anxiety, coming from one of the strangest of ideas. With our impending departure from Korea imminent, I find myself unexpectedly nervous about not seeing korean. Right now I'm looking out the window of an office in Busan, and on the signs, the advertisments, the businesses and apartments there is one concurrent theme: <em>hangul</em>.

It's become a bit of a habit to look at storefront signs and billboards-- even commercial vehicles--to see if I can decipher what it says; is there Konglish? is there a new vocabulary word hidden in the content? So many insights and amusements can be found by just looking around Korea. And I feel that those things, without exception, won't be there for me in the US. And that makes me a little sad.

Just another reason why I'm just not ready to go.

I may post some things today, but otherwise posting on leftsider will cease for a bit as the exodus begins. 

Time to actually start packing; we head to Seoul on friday. Then we'll be traveling in Japan four a few days, arriving in the States next thursday. Once we're there, however, I'll be making lots of trips to finalize our housing (and turn on the internet!), prepare for my job, and just send out a general "we're back!" So let's just say I should be back in the groove by mid-march.

Consider any posts before then an unexpected treat and a sign of my love and dedication to you. Or, proof of my internet addiction. heh. In the mean time, keep an eye on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/">my Flickr account</a> for the early jump on travelling pics.

Just scroll down and read some of the earlier posts and you'll see why this guy's un-navigable, feed-less, plain ol' blog is so darn popular among the korea folks.

Ah, February. My favorite month of dread. The time of year when most of the superficially minded nation to which I pledge allegiance spend four weeks talking about what old, and often dead, black americans did for the US. A time for people to remember, "Oh yeah! You're not just my friend and a cool guy, but you're black too! WOW!!!" A time for tributes.....from McDonalds.

Without going into why this pomp and circumstance has no greater tangible relevancy that of valentine's day, let me tell you that I'm not a big fan (note, that does not make me a hater, Kim). Despite living, eating, and breathing this stuff as a child, I think I've had my media full.

Thankfully TAN has brought some joy to my black history month with his perspective. For the first time in a while (which I've been meaning to complain about, TAN) the assimilated negro makes me laugh and remember that it's genius like this that makes us worthy participants in a global community.

Warning, this is a reactionary post.

The problem with being a lover of knowledge is that, as some point, you start to share it. It's actually quite noble and upstanding to share what you've gained, but ultimately people start to become ungrateful. In fact, they come to expect it. This is, without exception, rude.

Recently, people have looked to me for answers without a thread of appreciation. Especially in the area of computers, some people have become impatient and even belligerent as I assist them with THEIR problems, which of are no fault of my own. When I give tech support to a person on an OS I don't use (which means I'm following steps from memory ALONE) and give them multiple solutions which they can't seem to grasp I fail to see how I can be any less at fault. Yet it seems that people are getting more and more demanding of the free service they receive from leftsider.

Yesterday someone who consulted me on buying a mac left an IM message that read: "My powerbook has been at the Apple store for 20 days! APPLE SUCKS!" I can't help but feel a definite LACK of pity for this person. It's a rare day in Daegu when I turn my computer over to anyone else for any type of support. I feel that part of the reasons my computers always do well for me is that I've taken the time to watch them, fix them, listen to them. It's nothing so deep as inanimate objects having spirits or anything, more like a good mechanic knowing his car's needs from the way it sounds. Total understanding eliminates problems.

Moreover, there's a TON of information out there that can be useful. And scads of DIY tutorials and walkthroughs that can further enable you. But I guess it's easier to just bite the hand that feeds. I guess I understand now the woes of customer support reps.

If you happen to be assisted by anyone for any matter, please remember that they are doing you a favor and show them the appropriate amount of appreciation. It really goes a long way.

So I got a little weepy about leaving today. Even though we don't actually leave until saturday morning. While it seems a little ahead of schedule for tears, actually works out well since I'll be less likely to be all sobby getting on a plane.

For the record, I did not cry at all in the week before leaving the US. That's profound. The week before I wept, but that was because it was the last time i would see the house I grew up in; it got sold the next month. That's the last comparable weeping session; next session would be when they took Iva. And I can't remember weeping before that.

I like the word weeping, and I think it's underused. I wasn't injured or in pain, there was nothing that I was particularly frustrated about or anything like that. That's what I associate with crying. Something that is seemingly not of your intention. Weeping implies thoughtful sorrow; something recognized, accepted, yet still solemnly sad. Yeah, that's what it was.

I've got a lot of memories here, good and bad. I've got some accomplishments, some uncompleted  goals, and some things I never got around to. I've grown an enormous amount of respect for a people. I'm leaving a lot of that behind. I'm not happy about it, so I let one go, semi-privately. Frulwinn was around and kept following me around, sensing someting amiss. But you know, a guy needs solitary time to reflect on these things. There was nothing wrong; instead I was making everything right within myself.

I feel a lot better mentally now. Unfortunately, I'm feeling pretty weak otherwise. Perhaps my body is physically objecting to the exodus. I hit the 사우나 and 찜질방 this morning with mixed results. Tried staying warm but i'm still nursing a head and body ache. maybe I'll call it an early night.

Very touching man. Good luck with the movement transition, and I hope the both of you have a safe trip home after your vacation in Japan is it? Anyhow take it easy dude.. I know I wouldn't be as easy with a 15 hour plus flight ahead of me.. But thats for different but obvious reasons.

<em>Recently Leftsider met with Bryan Collick, who has just returned to the US after living in Korea since late 2004. Here are some excerpts from the conversation:</em>

<strong>LS:</strong> Welcome back, Bryan. Are you finding your reception pleasant?

<strong>BC:</strong> Absolutely. Between our families and my co-workers...it's almost like I'm a football hero.

<strong>LS:</strong> Co-workers...Are you working already?

<strong>BC:</strong> Yep. Today is day three. Really nice having a schedule again. It's not the best job I could have gotten but it's decent and it pays the bills. I've got an apartment to pay for after all. And Fru isn't working yet...

<strong>LS:</strong> So you have an apartment already as well! Wow, how long have you been back? 

<strong>BC:</strong> Well...(looks at watch) tonight will make exactly one week. And before you ask, no I'm not suffering from jetlag. I have a routine I follow which usually leaves me 80% adjusted when I arrive in a new time zone. Coming back I had a lot of things to accomplish in a short period of time, so I had to ensure that I was up and running as soon as possible. 

<strong>LS:</strong> Yeah that was my next question. I guess a lot of people are asking the same things.

<strong>BC:</strong> Yeah. Ironically, I think Korea prepared us for coming back from Korea. In Korea everyone you first meet usually asks how long you've been there, if you like it, what's your favorite food, and if you miss home. When you get back everyone asks, "Wow! how long have you been gone?" "How was Korea?" "Do you like Korean food?" and, of course, "Are you glad to be back?"

<strong>LS: </strong>Never thought of it that way, but yes. So are you glad to be back?

<strong>BC:</strong> No, but with explanation.

<em>Recently Leftsider met with Bryan Collick, who has just returned to the US after living in Korea since late 2004. this is the second part of the conversation:</em>

<strong>LS: </strong>So are you glad to be back?

<strong>BC:</strong> No, but with explanation.

<strong>LS:</strong> Please do.

<strong>BC:</strong> When I left for Korea, I didn't know what to expect. I had no idea what we were getting into, and we had to face a lot of challenges to come to the level of enjoyment that we did. Coming back, I had the same feeling--it's a good feeling. But unfortunately, nothing new or challenging is here; we literally are "back," with no progress on the homefront. It's a bit disheartening. 

<strong>LS:</strong> Ah, I think I understand. But are you sad because you feel that there's no growth here? Or is it because you're having to come back to that environment?

<strong>BC:</strong> Well I'm a selfish guy; so naturally the latter is very important to me. Still, when you come back to good friends and family, you want the best for them too.

<strong>LS:</strong> So why did you come back?

<strong>BC:</strong> It's my fault. Still dragging along on this higher education thingie. We had to come back to finish that. That's really what made us come back to Maryland, too.

<strong>LS:</strong> So you don't like the DC area either?

<strong>BC:</strong> Oh I love the DC area. But like I said, we're into moving forward; doing something new. But since I'm enrolled at UMUC I kinda need the instate tuition so here we are. 

<strong>LS:</strong> Well apparently there's something left in Korea that you feel you can move forward in.

<strong>BC:</strong> Korea, yeah. Asia, absolutely. And it's easier to get around asia with Korea as a hub than it would be from eastern US. And as you know, I'm studying korean language and have aspirations for chinese. I'd really like to get the full experience as I discover these cultures. 

You know I recently fell in love with Singapore, and our visit in Japan was really nice as well. Then there's still Philippines, China, Taiwan....the list goes on and on. Actually, there's a lot of America I haven't visited too, but right now what's pertinent is that I finish this degree. I'm considering some masters' programs on the west actually, so who knows.

Then, on March 13 it all exploded in one brutally violent, alleged gang rape. That is when %u2014 according to police reports %u2014 three white members of the team beat, sodomized, choked and raped a black exotic dancer who had come to entertain approximately 40 members of the team at a private, off campus party.

BODY:
I'm sluggish. I'm not easily excited. I'm sleeping a lot more (and, subsequently, surfing a lot less). I can't seem to get up to full speed. My mind is constantly cloudy for no apparent reason. My theory? Ironically, I think I may be experiencing culture shock.

Before I went to Korea I read a book about differences in culture and etiquette between the two countries. One thing it noted is that it can be detrimental to push yourself too hard; you are encountering a new world, and even at the subconscious level you're already working on overtime. The signs around you, the people talking as you pass--all that your mind would have recognized subconsciously in  your country, now it's having to acquaint itself with something uncharted. They said this to make you aware that even though you feel like you're lagging behind,  you're really going 100%.

That's kinda how I feel here. Even though I clearly understand every word on a sign or most going past me (there's a lot of different languages going on around here), there's still the fact that no one here understands anything that I've done in the past year. A month ago, everything I was doing made sense to everyone; now it's so hard to explain.

Friday my father was nice enough to suggest eating at a Korean restuarant. The food was okay, but what got me was that we all ate separately. Everyone relegated their eating to their own plate. Even the gochu pajeon! That dish made me....homesick(?), thinking about all the good times I went out with friends and acquaintances at places like Mu Dae Po (sorry, no korean fonts at work yet).

I say I need to stop thinking so much about Korea, but the more I try to ignore it the sadder I get. Some might call it Hostage Syndrome :P I think <a title="when blah became boring" href="http://www.leftsider.com/whenblah/">Fru is feeling a bit of it too</a>; she said she's been spending time looking though old photos since she's been back.

I'm not sure what I want to do now. I hope this rough patch will be done with soon. If anyone has any suggestions, let a brother know.

Interesting to see the way the discussion turns on this one. FWIW, I'm always suprised Korea doesn't have a poorer reputation than it does because of demonstrations and silliness like this.

But then again, look what's going on in Paris...

	To your left you'll see the kitchen. Nothing special, but quite enough for just the two of us. There's also a dining nook that we haven't taken full advantage of--korean living has completely put us off the traditional western dining conventions.<br />
<br />
Useless bit of trivia, this apartment is the mirror of the apartment we had before we left for Korea. So in our old apartment this would have been on the right.

	That dining nook still hasn't gotten a proper purpose yet. Maybe we'll put bookshelves there or something. As you can see, walking through will bring you around to the living room.

Does this sound like something I'd say or what?

"I personally do not frequent places many places where English teachers hang out. One of the reasons is that I get easily frustrated watch�a bunch of�grubby, unkempt, long greasy-haired men and other people that look like they crawled out of the shallow end of the gene pool and into Darwin%u2019s waiting room gripe about how they are treated badly at work.� They should be lucky they are allowed to work looking like that.� I think all institutes should have strict dress codes.� However, suggesting a written dress code is unnecessary as every Korean knows how to dress for work.� It%u2019s just the foreigners how walk around with the attitude of %u201CI%u2019ve just got to be me.� What does it matter how I look if I do my job well?%u201D� The short answer is that to Koreans, it matters A LOT what people look like.� You as a foreigner are more noticeable and should therefore be trying extra hard to get the respect you so desparately want, but so seldom deserve.� Appearance and attitude go a long way to help avoid problems and to help resolve problems that do occur."

So you wanna hear music? Glad you asked.

You know I've felt bad that <a href="http://mykoreapop.blogspot.com">my podcast show</a> has been silent for over a month now, but my external hard drive with all my content was left in Korea and is just now being shipped (hopefully) carefully (hopefully!!!) back to me here. So even I've been struggling with a lack of tunes to live life to.

Well, until the next podcast, feel free to listen to guys so much better than I. Although it's not Korean, my all-time most lovable DJ, Mr. Scruff, has a online radio show I just discovered that you might find interesting. it's called <a title="hot pot radio : mr scruff vs. treva whateva : archive" href="http://www.hotpotradio.com/archive.asp">hot pot radio</a>--have a listen. 

If it's a little too wacky for you, there's a much wider range of stuff available from <a href="http://milkaudio.com/web/livemix_archive.php">milkaudio's archive</a>, spanning back to way back when....2000!

Ok, enjoy...and don't get spoiled and stop looking for the podcast.

BODY:
Today I ate lunch with a friend at a chinese resturaunt I've only been to previously with Joey. At the end of the meal, we received our complimentary fortune cookies and the bill. I always open my fortune cookie, and today I was met by this phrase:

<center> The only good is knowledge
and the only evil ignorance</center>

My brain is mush most of the time now due to my reintroduction to cubicle life, so I pocketed the slip of paper for later. Now, looking it at it, I'm still no more sure than I was at first glance.

Although it's hard to actually quantify, it could be said that most evil exists as a result of ignorance. If a sucker wasn't born every minute, a lot of opportunities for evil would cease to exist. In that sense, knowledge would prevent evil as much as it would prevent ignorance. In addition, we could probably eliminate the section of evil done "because they didn't know any better."

But I still hesitate to confirm the other half, that knowledge is the only good. What about kindess, love, and, well, innocence? are these things not good? can these things not exist without knowledge? 

Perhaps a clearer and more valid interpretation would be that knowledge exposes the good, while ignorance begets evil. Still not completely true, but one could argue that good would never be discovered without a knowledge of what good actually is. Conversely, even evil things seem good to unknowing eyes.

It's good to find something to mull over like this (and no, I'm not done mulling). With the exception of V for Vendetta, this might be the only thing I've found in the US sofar that really has requested my thought. Speaking of which, I started back on the korean study and my brain zaps out faster than ever these days. Help me stay in mental vigor; what's your take on my fortune cookie?

Otherwise, be content to rollerblade in a circle at world cup stadium and various spots around the city.

To the person who reached this site looking for obese koreans: There are none. That's it. But if you stay long enough, you'll find people  that you think are grotesquely overweight; then you'll come back the the US and remember that, like Leftsider told you, there are no obese koreans.

My thinking on this subject is paralell to yours Lefty. I just have a question though. Was the Adam and Eve situation in the garden of Eden an example of this phrase in opposites? Meaning were they good only because they had no knowledge of good and evil? And when they did aquire that knowledge(ate the forbiden fruit) of good and evil at what point did their increasing knowledge steer them towards good again?

	Our second bedroom, re-titled the work room, also has had major changes. This is, honestly, where I spend most of my time. I guess that's not much of a surprise. I'll probably have another pic of this room up eventually, so be sure to take a look at my photostream.

...I started to think about the guy I yelled at on the street. I had been riding my bike crazily. I should have left early enough to walk to eye surgery. And I shouldn't have called him that in front of his mother.

And now, because of the bad karma this had no doubt engendered from the Universe, I was going to be blinded in one eye. No more playing catch. Only one option for winking. For my birthday, people would give me parrots....

Talking from his cellphone, he was adamant about the rightness of his cause. "American Apparel is the new normal," he said. "It's fun to say, 'He's wild and crazy,' but I'm not wild and crazy. This is the way the adult generation is going to live. They're not preoccupied by monogamy. Exciting things can happen. They're mobile; they can travel; they're willing to take chances; they're open-minded and ready for change. That's what the boomers presented for America, and that's what this new generation presents for us. I want to be in business with them."

	One of the reasons that I tried to get back into our old community is because I fell in love with our corner location overlooking the community pool and recreational area. The sound of kids playing, lots of grass and trees; I dug that.<br />
<br />
It was an added bonus that our apartments have two large windows and a balcony that extends to both sides. A bonus which I additionally have fallen in love with.

This is not news; this is expected. And it's also a common outcome of a boycott. Duh. They should be happy with the relatively low percentages of this occuring. Also, media should recognize that this can also be affected by an employee's prior performance/attendance.

For the purposes of instruction at Mansour High, and most schools across Iraq, history ends in 1968, before the bloodless coup that swept the Baath Party to power.

For me to read later. I forgot about this girl and how funny she, well, looks. I've never seen her on anything but commercials, but her overly expressive face and actions always conjure a snicker. Little things I miss about Korea.

The croquet match held every spring on the lawn of St. John's College in Annapolis is a perennial inside joke. Long ago, the commandant of the U.S. Naval Academy challenged a St. John's freshman to find an athletic contest the bookish, hirsute Johnnies could actually win. And win they have, virtually every year since 1983.

Sofar this is pretty good. I appreciate the fact that although he's not an observant religious practitioner he's a believer nonetheless, and hasn't sought to prove or disprove anything. He merely wants to find out what the Bible (Torah, specifically) really has to say--for himself.

Quite honestly, I think this is what every self-professed follower of the Bible should do. Although the tongue-in-cheek reflections can be optional for your reading. :P

The economists Philip Martin, Manolo Abella and Christiane Kuptsch noted in a recent book, "As a general rule, the more difficult it is to migrate from one country to another, the higher the percentage of professionals among the migrants from that country." Often this means that the more "backward" the country, the more "sophisticated" the immigrants it supplies.

BODY:
This weekend we dropped by a friend's house with a movie and snacks in tow. The movie? A Korean comedy translated as "<a href="http://www.hancinema.net/korean_movie_My_Boss_v__My_Teacher.php">My Boss, My Teacher</a>." The friends? My pal Paul (the guy who got me started studying korean and a major influence in going over there) and his Korean wife, Sook Kyung. 

Paul is a bit of a film snob. He's not a full on blowhard; actually, it'd probably be more accurate to say that he has his own unique taste. He tries to explain and rationalize it, but really it all boils down to personal preference. While I can definitely figure out what movies he disdains, I'd be hard pressed to explain what type of movie he enjoys; for this reason, I guess I'll take back the film snob title and replace it with a title of eccentricity.

The reason that I explain this is because Paul thought the movie was awful. Sook Kyung liked it. Fru got a good laugh out of it, and I validated it for what it was--a modern Korean comedy.

If you've looked into Korean film recently, you'd have noticed this progressing trend:
<blockquote>1. A Korean comedy must involve a cop, a gangster, and/or a high school student (romantic comedies can opt out if they include a horribly mismatched pairing)
2. A Korean comedy must get serious for approximately 20 minutes around the 4th quarter of the film.
3. A Korean comedy gets its laughs not from the jokes told but from the characters' reactions to various events.
4. A Korean comedy invariably has a relatively horrible ending. No unpredicted twists, no cliffhangers.</blockquote>

For a guy like Paul, and for most of the Western world, this kind of movie gets the "cheesy" stamp. Most people don't like cheese in their films, and so these would probably classify as straight-to-video fodder. Paul noted that night that it seemed that Korean cinema was full of horrible attempts at filmaking and that he could almost count on one hand how many movies he felt were top-notch. 

I argued that this was not to Korean cinema's fault. One must understand that the culture, the mindset, and the demand is different there than it is in a country like ours. 

If Korea is anything, it is pop. It is sensationalist, it is surreal; it feeds off of dreams and imagination and strong emotion. Korean soaps, music videos--even news--all attest to this. It's not about substance; it's about zeitgeist.

Movies that delve deep in to plot or analytical thought are relegated to small openings and arthouse scenes. Same with music. As I debated this, I pointed to <a href="http://www.redhotchilipeppers.com/">RHCP</a>'s nauseating performance on Saturday Night Live and asked him to think of any Korean musician who had been around as long as these guys and still got on a Saturday night show (besides an old-school <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ds5ErbbIFxo">"gayo" special</a>) to perform their music. He conceded this point.

While I don't think we came to complete agreement, I think it's a worthwhile argument. Just like the US rap/hiphop scene, Korea's entertainment culture is not even set up to have long-standing stars and ideologies. People and fancies come and go like the wind, so it's ridiculous to assume that you'll find poignancy and depth in a comedy. Don't set yourself up for disappointment.

I thought this was interesting though, because I hadn't actually approached Korean society from that perspective. I t hought it was worth noting and discussing further.

Interesting insight.  I've been in Korea for four years but I'm just getting into Korean movies.  Your thoughts on Korean cinema as a reflection of the ever-changing pop culture scene is consistent with my observations.  

It is natural and easy, though unfair, to apply the same standards of judgement to Korean movies, music, and literature as we do to our own.  That said, I believe Korean media has yet to come of age.

Thanks for commenting!

I believe that Korean media has come of age--after all, their history is much longer than the US. And as long as there are people making history, there are people sharing the news. That, ideally, is media.

In a broader scope, movies essentially reflect the essence of the people. Their thoughts, where they are personally. Anything that tries to promote something otherwise is usually discredited as propaganda. 

To that end, Korean cinema must be exactly the age of the people. Thinking that way, the only reason Korean media in general could be considered yet to come of age would be if the Korean people are yet to come of age. And that's a whole 'nother topic. ;)

"Geoffrey Vos QC, representing Apple Corps, told Mr Justice Mann at the high court in London in March that to call the download system just an electronic device was a "perversion" of the constraints laid down in the agreement between the two companies.

He said Steve Jobs, who founded Apple Computer, had said that the downloading of music from the internet was exactly the same as buying an LP in the modern world."

So the world where, 3 years ago, 1million songs were downloaded from itunes is not the modern world? Or, more accurately, the Beatles were not part of the post-modern world?

BODY:
A couple weeks ago I had a fun conversation with a friend of mine. Rachel is from Uganda and works somewhere in my building as a grant accountant. Having been in the US a couple years, she has an interesting perspective combined with that blunt East African charm I discovered when I visited in 2001.

"Bryan, you crossed the line!" she spouted, jokingly. This was in reference to my marriage to my Fru, who is Filipino. "Actually, it's ok," she said. "I'm thinking about trying some other colors too." You have to have the accent there for full impact. 

We noted some issues that Black Americans have, and that African Americans have (there's a difference). We noted that certain Black islander communities seem to have somehow escaped these problems, and we wondered why. I gave her my running routine about how I'm opposed to any relationship--or anything else, for that matter--that adds stress to my life, no matter how conventional it is. She noted that dating interracially was not without its own share of stressors.

And then she knocked me back with a statement: "You know, I think that mixed couples are a bigger issue here than in Uganda."

Really? How could you figure? It's a completely African culture, and she admitted that there are problems as small as which tribe you are affiliated with when it comes to meeting and mating. So to hear that statement puzzled me and confused her as well.

After talking about it a bit more we came to the theory that because the country is largely people of one background, everyone has to come to terms with one issue. Sure there are people who disapprove, even despise it, but after that it's done. It's just a matter of preference.

On the other hand, the United States is a complete mix of backgrounds. We face more than just tradition. Subcultures within the US are constantly battling with relevancy. Am I Mexican or am I American? Am I black or am I African? Am I Native American? Am I just a native American? Am I white or Italian? The confusion continues, and each interracial couple is another whack at the walls which define us. 

And before you cheer, remember that if those walls completely erode, then no one will have any past heritage to share. Does my history really begin when the slave ships arrived at the continent? Does your history end with you when your child has two ancestral lines which have no relation to the life they live today? Confusion continues.

For this reason, we theorized that there would be a bigger issuer around mixed couples in the US until the country came to some sort of universal consensus about who we are and how we approach our culture. Until then, confusion continues. 

What about Korea? Do you think it supports or disputes this argument?

<p class="flickr-yourcomment">
	About two years ago, my fiancee (now wife) was invited to a party her coworker was having in Roslyn, Virginia. Even though it snowed just before we kept our promise to attend.<br />
<br />
Once we found the place we looked for parking, which was a good distance away. Stepping out into the frigid air, I noticed a photo on the ground. This is that photo.<br />
<br />
Because I found this photo particularly ironic since I was bundled up and freezing to death, I tossed it into the car instead of back on the ground. I thought about posting the photo to my site, leftsider, or to craigslist to find the owner.<br />
<br />
But I forgot and a week later, to remind myself, put the pic on our refrigerator. A few people noted the absence of females in the picture and had a few jokes at this poor soul's expense. As a result of one of those jokes, his name became "Ben."<br />
<br />
Ben stayed on my fridge for a year. I left with my new bride for a 1-year assignment to South Korea. One week later, my roomate died. All my stuff I had left was either thrown away, given away, or lost, save a few choice things my father managed to retreive.<br />
<br />
I thought about Ben once, but only because I was thinking about the fun times with my deceased roommate. I wished I had actually done what I had intended for Ben, or whoever took this fabulous picture of him.<br />
<br />
Today, I've been back in the US for a month or so. My wife went through some containers of crap we had yet to sort and, lo and behold, there was Ben. She put him on my laptop, where she knew I'd see him as soon as I got home. <br />
<br />
I couldn't stop smiling.<br />
<br />
So, internet, this is Ben. I don't know Ben, but he's on my fridge right now. If you know Ben, tell him I've got his picture, and that I'd love to give it to him. If you don't know Ben, ask someone if they do--particularly if they live(d) near Roslyn Metro.<br />
<br />
I think if I ever meet Ben and return this photo, it may be a bit awkward. There's a lot that has changed in my life since that frozen night, and this pic embodies a lot of memories. But it's something that I said I'd do, and I feel that it would bring some happiness and closure to the whole deal.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping the internet will do it's magic for me and find Ben. Flickr seems like a good place to start.

The men's testosterone levels were also tested - by comparing the length of the men's index finger compared to their ring finger."

BODY:
Some of you may not know what I'm doing in the US. I've been here for two months, yet I don't think I've given any indication to my current occupations.

A while back I worked for a large non-profit organization for a few years. Started off as a temp, then contractual, and eventually landed a full-time spot. l was young and eager when I worked there last, and even took my own time off to work an event with a department other than my own. After working two 80+ hour weeks, I left an impression strong enough do be pursued by that department's director in February, nearly six years later. 

Leaving Asia behind, I arrived in Virginia on March 8. Two days later, I was still in Virginia, but I had been to Maryland, gotten our apartment keys, and taken a formal employment test. That Monday, the 13th, I was at work at 8am.

Coming back to work here has been an experience. All of the reasons I left in the first place (including my need to finish school) are still there, same as ever. Same people, same confusion; but did I mention I got a job before I even came back?

When I left before, I was working mostly with video production and satellite broadcasting. This time I'm dealing with print production and content side of event preparation. I've got two bosses, both of whom are fresh from other countries. They're eager to show their mettle, and I think they are a bit skeptical of me. After all, when I arrived the whole department knew me, top level employees come by to say hi, VPs greet me, and I'm not necessarily in the "I'm new so let me impress my boss" mode.

All of this calls for a very bumpy ride. Initially I was game, then I started looking for other options, but right now I'm tentatively sticking it out for a bit. If there's anything I'm known for in my working (besides always being known) is that I really come to work to solve problems and make things easier. There's a lot of work to be done in that regard, and I'm hoping it'll shape me up so that once the issues have been cleared I can move right on into autopilot and focus on my studies.

Yes, I haven't forgotten the studies. Currently signed up for ten hours this summer. I'm actually looking forward to it, as it may be my only opportunity to interact with new people and discover new, interesting things. I have little else to look forward to, as everything else seems to mandate looking back. 

*sigh*

BODY:
I was hanging around and doing my thing, talking to people and making connections. I bumped in to Joey along the course of my socializing, so naturally we decided to ride home together.

We talked about stuff, laughing and joking in our usual way; Joey talked about the stupidity of one thing or the other and I tried to bring out the bright side in a humorous manner. We got home and sat down and just continued in light conversation.

Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. "Joey," I asked after having a nice laugh over something, "Am I going crazy?"

He looked at me funny, but didn't say anything--almost as if he wasn't sure if I was serious or priming another punchline. "Cause if I'm not crazy," I said, "How are you here when you died last January?"

"That's because I...." He started, but then his eyes got that faraway look as if he really had to think about this one. "It's, well, it's.....I died....yeah....well I guess the reason is.....uh....yeah I died...."

"And if I'm not crazy," I continued, slowly starting to lose composure, "Why am I the only one that can see you?"

Joey just sat there, on the sofa, and I, sitting on the floor, bowed my head as a wave of emotions I couldn't contain started forward. But before I could let go, I realized that I was lying, face-down, in my bed. 6:30am, with the begininngs of tears in the corners of my eyes.

What a way to start a Monday. I'm sure this week's going to be fun. :(

A theory, based on some things I haven't mentioned.

The things that I have not mentioned officially are that Frulwinn and I are using <a href="http://www.helio.com">Helio</a> as our mobile provider and that I have been accepted as a member of <a href="http://www.cyworld.com">Cyworld</a>. Also, I've decided to do my Anthropology class mini-ethnograpy on the Cyworld experience.

Here's the theory: prepare to bow to your Korean overlords. The Borg is coming and you will be assimilated. 

To spare you who prefer to lightly peruse, I'll explain more after the jump.
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
Helio, the MNVO partnership between Earthlink and SK (Korea's largest mobile communications company) has gotten off to a rough start, to be honest. Our phones are way cool, but the plans are pricey, the internet connectivity is spotty (granted I've only used mobile phone internet in Korea), and the content is slim at best. Add to that technical issues with Korean text messages, international messaaging, and MMS.....it's a wonder it hasn't folded already. I've really been disappointed sofar, and cannot recommend the service.

Just a few weeks ago I finally obtained the green light for membership to Cyworld. I had been halfheartedly attempting to do it all through my time in Korea, and worked at it in earnest once I returned to the US. Now that I had it, the next thing I wanted to do was use it on the go--like I would in Korea. The fact that I had a Korean phone powered by a Korean telecom giant made it seem like a no-brainer to me. Boy was I wrong.

My vendor of choice (who <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/25/AR2006062500763.html">happens to be Korean</a>) called Helio and pitched a fit when he discovered the problems we were having and the fact that Cyworld is not accessible through the phones. "Isn't this done with SK? What Korean doesn't have Cy?" he berated, in Korean. "If this can't be fixed, then they should be able to cancel their account with no penalties!" The Korean-speaking CSR quietly acquiesed.

Meanwhile, I became more and more fascinated with Cy. Not that there's anything there that I'm particularly interested  in, but that all my friends are there, and all their friends as well....and about a third of the Korean population while we're at it. What makes it so popular? I chose it as my ethnographical topic as an excuse to spend more time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyworld">figuring it out</a>.

Here's what I discoveed. I knew that Cy was a part of Nate, but I did not know that Cy was purchased by SK a few years ago and bundled wtih Nate upon acquisition. Nate, you may recall, is the company that took Microsoft to court under the claim that MS messenger's inclusion in the Windows OS was monopolistic and unfair to their messaging client NateOn. I also discovered that Cyworld actually has a US version in closed beta as we speak.

Rolling all these things in my head, I came to see a larger plan forming. Cy-US will open, and then Helio will provide access and receive content from it. Helio's partnership with Myspace is merely a way to work out the kinks while the Beta hashes out its issues. Cy-ROK would not be advantageous to implement here in the US since it requires your Korean ID (or a long, untranslated, foreigner submission). And all that wonkiness with the messaging may be a result of this preparation.

Imagine, if you will, an online social networking site that is accessible via the web or by an application on your mobile device. No matter where you access it you will be able to edit your site, upload and download pictures, visit your friend's sites, and communicate via IM. What you are imagining is Cy in Korea. And you are looking at the foundations of that same system being built here in US. 

I think it's a bold, smart move by SK. Anyone looking to get in while the cement's still curing, I'm available to teach you basic Korean via IM for a reasonable cost. :)

I think this is a fantastic idea for a company that I think actually has it right when reinventing itself. Maybe I should just keep my mouth shut before I jinx them. heh.

For the record, I will say that I've been playing with Y!360 recently, and it is more like Cyworld than anything else I've seen in the US. And that's a compliment.

I've been contemplating a change in philosophy regarding games. If I do accept this new line of thinking, I may never buy a console again.

Today, more than ever, everything I do is mobile. My primary machine is a laptop; my backup is on a portable drive. I sync my calendar, contacts and notes between my PDA, mobile, and computers. So why would I want to be tethered to a home appliance to play games? I think that even the manufacturers know this. Now every console has online play, wireless controllers...but is that enough? Portable gaming takes it the next step; in your hand, wherever you go.

What's more, consoles seem to be going crazy in price. The $400 Xbox360 seems downright practical in comparison with the PS3. I was a Sony fanboy for a long, long time--basically until I went to Korea. Never before have I been so uninterested in a Playstation console than I am now. Regardless of what it's capable of doing, I find it unreasonably priced.  I could buy a PSP and a DSlite to take with me wherever I go....and probably have enough change left over for a Wii.

I figured that if I could do classes Monday through Thursday  from 6-10 if I just went in to work earlier. Seven in the morning to 5pm would give me time to get between locations with minimal tardiness. Since I live really close to work I could still squeeze in 6-7 hours a night for sleep, which was all I was used to anyway.

What I hadn't calculated was homework/reading time, and since this is a summer session they really pile it in. But Fridays and Sundays were free so I figured I'd just have to forego my usual social lifestyle as a tribute to dedicated study. 

So if everything is set to work, why do I keep getting sidetracked? Meetings with the financial advisor, short notice parental visits, weekend trips....it's all very counterproductive. It would seem that Leftsider is the only outlet that hasn't really required my presence, so let me say thanks to all of you who have endured the slowdown. 

Enjoy a few links in appreciation.

The findings by Alan Smithers, Professor of Education at Buckingham University and one of Britain's most respected schools experts, will come as a shock to parents convinced their daughters would benefit from an all-girl environment. Half a century of research 'has not shown any dramatic or consistent advantages for single-sex education' for boys or girls, he will conclude.

Our motivation to make computer games the way that we do, stems from the fact that we enjoy certain aspects of commercial computer games a lot, but dislike others with a passion. So we try to make computer games without all the things that we don't like (competition, meaningless violence, strict rules, predefined goals, canned stories). We also try to add a certain level of authorship that we feel is lacking in commercial games. They often feel too much like products that fell off an assembly line in some toy factory than deepfelt expressions of creative people.

The Endless Forest in particular was motivated by a desire to create a peaceful social environment. Online games very often seem like dressed up single player games. We try to design interactions that invite playing with each other. We also consciously removed all ways in which players could hurt or annoy each other. That's why there is no chat in the game, for instance.

Now that it's all over for Korea, we can at least remember their unbelievable fan support. It's hard to lose when so many people are faithfully cheering you on. Let's remember, too, that these last two games started in Korea at four in the morning! Now that's dedication.

I have, though I haven't read it. My problem isn't about finding ways to do things; it's actually doing them. Low motivation is a bastard.

Also, I'm still kinda dealing with the whole "being back in the US" thing. I don't feel completely on the ball, in general.

I understand...reverse culture shock can be a pain to handle.

Still, GTD might be just what you're looking for. Low motivation and low energy aren't all that different, and GTD might be a good tool to fight your way through it.

Mildy interesting exhibition, but the picture of the wall-mounted ipod reminded me of an experience we had while visiting in Tokyo.

The second evening we wandered around Shibuya just seeing what was around and peeking into shops. One street was particularly nice and had more than one gallery or store that put me face to face with things that I had previously only seen in publications like <em>Wallpaper</em> and websites like <em>we make money not art</em>. On this street, whe stopped into a small boutique store/gallery that had four ipods mounted on its large front window. Under each ipod was a black circle, also installed into the window. 

I looked at the setup and surmised that the black circles were used as some sort of sensor, which controlled which ipod played music inside the store. Upon entering the store and seeing the turntables in the back, spinning away, I soon realized that the ipods were just ipods--the black circles were headphone jacks that passers-by could plug into and just listen.

Using the ipods in this way, and with no incentive to move people any further than the storefront window, was completely fascinating to me. 

I should have taken a picture, but I was (probably unnecessarily) concerned with the store and artists' feelings about their work and ideas being photographed.

On the return trip from our New York excursion, I realized that this trip had been the first time in ages that I wasn't adhering to a rigid schedule. We had planned two outings for the four-day trip, and the rest of the time was spent following our whims--or doing nothing at all. It's been a long time since I've been able to do that; since Korea, basically.

What I noticed, however, was that the whole trip seemed better because of it. If we had done more, rushing here and there, dragging friends and family along with us, I think the stress level would have been much higher. Instead, we did less, let things flow, and enjoyed a trip with no tensions. For some reason, this triggered a tangental trane of thought...why can't my life always be like this?

Looking at my model group--the rich and successful--I suppose their life is very much like that. They are responsible for big things and wield remarkable power, but they do very little. I'd imagine that they have someone who does their housekeeping, cooking, driving, etc., allowing them to only involve themselves when they want to; making even mundane tasks more enjoyable.

In their business, it should be much the same. The CEO steers the ship while others implement the directives they give. The captain lends a hand on a whim or when Davey Jones threatens to take the company under (sorry; watched Pirates II last weekend. Cragon!).

I wonder if I can do more to live my life in this way. If I try to do everything myself, I have not resources remaining for dreaming, planning, R&D. My vision becomes more short-sighted and my goals lose coherence. It boils down to just fighting a stressful, solitary battle to survive.

I am very interested in words, and what we have words for and what we haven't got words for. For instance, the word "paranoia." It always seems very strange to me that we have this word which means, in effect, that someone feels that he is being persecuted when the people who are persecuting him don't think that he is. But we haven't got a word for the condition in which you are persecuting someone without realizing it, which I would have thought is as serious a condition as the other, and certainly no less common.

I don't know if I've mentioned this before, but part of my responsibilities in my current position has made me assistant editor of a quarterly denominational magazine. It's weird being an assistant editor, but hey, it beats my official position title.

Today I sat at lunch and was joined  by two other individuals who were involved with denominational publications. As it turned out, they also were both assistant editors at their repsective rags. I decided, as a result of that conversation, that I need to be more careful so that I don't turn into a one-trick blowhard.

Smoking scenes are to be edited out of classic Tom & Jerry cartoons, following a complaint to the broadcast regulator that they are inappropriate for a show aimed at children.

I initially noticed this post for the attached picture, but the entry itself says quite a bit as well.

As a full-time worker and two credits shy of a full-time student, I find very little time for actual physical interaction with new people, friends and acquaintances. I find that online messaging and social networking systems keep me in touch with not only the friends I've left behind in Korea but also <em>those who are around me now</em>; more than actual physical meetings do, in fact.

You know that you've reached a milestone in ubiquity when you 
use two of these tools to communicate with your boss--whether he's on the other side of the world or <em>on the other side of the wall</em> in his office!

Is it an acceptable alternative? What is lost and what is gained? What more is left for internet-enabled interaction?

Just finished talking with Walter, who is on a mission trip from Korea to Japan. It's a holiday in Japan right now, so they are relegated to sightseeing until the festivities finish. 

Cesar left a message on his Myspace page, sharing the fun and adventure he's experiencing on his mission trip to Belize. Despite what he considered to be abject primitivity, he apparently is well connected and asks that we keep in touch via email while he's gone. 

My coworkers Mervyn and Mark arrived last week from a 3-week mission trip to Philippines. Lots of fresh fruit and tropical weather, hard work and over 100 baptisms. Of course, they also got to tour and see some sights while there as well. 

My in-laws practically met them in the airport, leaving for a mission trip to Kenya early monday morning. There they will help to build a parsonage next to the church that was built last trip, so that it will encourage the Union to place a pastor and his family in that village. Many pastors in Africa have numerous churches, but it's always nice to have your church be his "home church."

Building relationships with the people is nice as well. That's what Onyx thought was the best part of his recent mission trip from Korea to Mongolia. He worked through an interpreter to talk to the people--though he naturally is a magnet for children--and hope to keep in contact with the few people he managed to build ties with while he was there.

Me? Well, I just sit in this cubicle, then go to class, then go home....

Finally got away for a few days, and I think that I'm feeling better for it. A chance to not think about class requirements, work projects, friend issues, etc. I highly recommend it.

Besides seeing Ronaldinho play live and watching a great game in Yankee Stadium in the same short respite (as if that isn't great enough!), I also tried to get some time in for thought. One thing I thought about--the puprose for this post--was how much I really prefer "the District" to "the Big Apple."

After living in Daegu, quite possibly the most urban living situation of my life, Fru and I felt real withdrawal moving back to the comparatively rural lifestyle of east coast suburbia. While we still had alternative modes of transportation and a bevy of interesting things to see and do, The bus was too infrequent, the train was to far, and the cabs were too expensive. Further, our friends now were less interested in joining us on excursions, particularly ones that involved said public transportation.

For this reason, along with others, I've actually wondered recently if I'd enjoy living in New York City better. I've never thought about living in NYC seriously; not that I dislike it, just that it seems like a nice place to visit--not to live in. Yet now, as I'm looking to be more aptly stimulated, could New York be a better fit?

It's the city that never sleeps; the most recognized American city in the world. I spent the past four days there and it's all true. The best pizza in the world. Style and attitude abound. But I felt that there was a tremendous burden to maintain this symbolism of cool, to a point that is can really smother pure, innocent and uninhibited growth and creativity. I think that DC, being a small city that only recently started being hip, has a real clean creativity about it. There are a lot of people who want it to be a New York, or a Miami, or a Chicago; but it is what it is, and that's what makes it uniquely enjoyable. This is something that I said about Daegu as well, when comparing it to Seoul.

Probably the biggest thing that I discovered during this trip that I hadn't realized before is that I find DCers much more attractive than New Yorkers. I was shocked by this, as both are very well blended culturally. New Yorkers edge us out on style, but just general good looks goes to DC. I know this is not an objective category, but it really is important that if you must put up with attitude, at least there is something visually rewarding. heh.

One area I haven't really been able to quantify is also an area I haven't been able to correctly name. It involves the ease at which a person can think progressively, envision possibilities, and find a community of people interested similarly in looking down that road (although possibly from different perspectives. I haven't run into that kind of person in NY, but I think that may be because I'm usually with family when I'm up there....not with colleagues and associates. I think that these might be evenly matched, but I'd like to be more knowledgeable about  that whole thing.

So I arrived home today, and I was glad to be back. I definitely would rather live in the District. New York will always hold a special stage that DC cannot hope to aspire to, but I'll still be content just to visit.

Instead of being guided by the invisible hand of stupidity, take some conscious control of your spending. Are you just spending on eating out? When was the last time you spent money strategically to try to gain something useful? Yes, it's actually good to spend money on things you value. Yes, it's important to spend money on things that will benefit you financially, intellectually, whatever.

BODY:
Kim Go Eun, better known as <a title="Artist of the week - Byul - soompi.com" href="http://soompi.com/?q=node/473">Byul</a> (the Korean word for 'star'), recently released her third album, 눈물샘.

I didn't initially know it as 눈물샘, because someone gave the album to me digitally and the korean got corrupted. When I went to YesAsia to find the album title, they said the title was "<a href="http://us.yesasia.com/en/PrdDept.aspx/aid-50515/section-music/code-k/version-all/pid-1004116751/">Lachrymal Glands</a>."

A quick look to google explained <a href="http://education.vetmed.vt.edu/Curriculum/VM8054/Labs/Lab11/Eye/EXAMPLES/EXTRGLND.HTM">what lachrymal glands are</a>.....and a quick use of its language tool translated 눈물샘 somewhat more accurately as "a tear spring." As realization set in, so did the humor.

Now that I'm thinking about it, though, I'm not sure how that could be aptly translated in English. The source of my tears? Tear wells? Tear ducts have no real marketability, and  lachrymal glands sounds like medical research more than it does a ballad album.

Picking up the meme from Kottke's explanation, here are my five:
<ul><li>To believe in God or in a guiding force because someone tells you to is the height of stupidity. We are given senses to receive our information within. With our own eyes we see, and with our own skin we feel. With our intelligence, it is intended that we understand. But each person must puzzle it out for himself or herself.(Sophy Burnham)</li>

<li>Good teaching is one-fourth preparation and three-fourths theater.(Gail Godwin)</li>

<li>Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage -- to move in the opposite direction.(E. F. Schumacher)</li>

<li>Never try to tell everything you know. It may take too short a time.(Norman Ford)</li>

<li>Comedy is simply a funny way of being serious.(Peter Ustinov)</li>

This morning, while looking for my card reader, I rummaged through two of my bags and found coinage from six countries (U.S. included). It's incredible to think that I've done that type of travelling in the last two years; it's nothing extensive, but it is far more international travel than I could have imagined for myself ten years ago.

Still, looking at those coins did not make me feel accomplished. On the contrary, I felt that just as they indicated money I did not spend, there were encounters and experiences in these countries that I had not tasted yet. It also made me look forward, wondering when I'd next be able to spend this loose change--or when I'd be able to add another denomination to the set.

When does a person feel that they have seen/experienced enough? I once lived with an old lady who had spent her entire life (save one trip to Florida) in a 90-mile radius. She was completely happy with her experiences and had no want for new horizons. I, on the other hand, have already visited about a dozen countries and I've still <a href="http://www.43places.com/person/leftsider">a list of places I still want to see</a>! Any ideas for a remedy for wanderlust?

BODY:
I have two pair of glasses that I wear regularly, though not daily. Funny thing is, I don't need glasses. That's right, I have two frames with clear glass in them. 

I started this habit in Korea. I found myself in a world of stereotypes: <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/archives/2006/02/koreansjust_lik.htm">Korean</a>, <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/archives/2005/08/leftsider_the_h.htm">ESL teachers</a> and military all have their own idiosyncracies. I, however, was an anomaly; people were constantly trying to assume who I was and what I was up to. Their assesment, in my opinion, ran something like this:

Military: Teacher
Teachers: Source of marijuana (I kid; English teachers NEVER do drugs!)
Koreans: ........uh.......rapper? musician? african?.......wait, you're not a teacher, are you?

So I tried to buy custom sunglasses using my then-shoddy Korean and ended up ordering <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/14136048/">some glasses with a nice tint</a>. To save face, I just bought them and would wear them on occasion. It was almost immediately that I saw the difference.....people actually believed me when I said I was a student learning Korean. No one asked if I was a rapper! And, for those who wanted to place me in a box, I now required more than just a first-glance assessment to be categorized. 

The glasses became my tool for being fairly observed. They became a part of my real-world social networking system as they granted me access to a larger group of people. Ultimately, I lost those spectacles in Singapore, so I went back and bought <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/239249355/">trendier ones</a>. 

I say all this because yesterday, at lunch, my friend Marvin <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blast&defid=1370975">put me on blast</a> as we were paying the bill. "Are those glasses even prescription?" He laughed.

"Uh, no. They're <a href="http://asiapages.wordpress.com/2006/09/08/one-dimensional-beauty/">cosmetic</a>."

"Did you see him?" He asked. "He put his glasses on to look at the receipt. Wh-aaa-t a placebo!"

He's right. I totally didn't do that intentionally, but the glasses have become <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/123770480/">such a part of my life now</a> that <strong>I, as a perpetrator, assume the habits of people who are legitimate</strong>, like Marvin. I can think of other examples; I also carried my korean phone along with me and used its local games and apps despite the fact that it did not work in the U.S.

Sure, laugh at me now. But have you ever faked a phone call to avoid a conversation? Tried to look busy in the office when the boss was on a rampage? Have you ever put on a happy face to share in someone's joy when you really felt pretty crappy? Are these things all that different?

Anyway, It was interesting to observe the multiple functions served by my fake glasses.

BODY:
I have basically been converted to Mac, but I refuse to commit simply because some things really irk me about how Apple does some things. Here's a perfect example:

I've never been a big fan of <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/">iTunes</a>. When transferring my PC's music library to my new iBook, files were copied in an unrecognizable sequence....which meant when the network connection hiccuped I got stuck with about 70 half-albums. In addition, it did not give me the option of controlling how my files were stored, as RealPlayer and WMP had....and turned a dozen or so compilation albums into about 50 one-song folders. I was not amused. To say we started off on a bad foot would be an understatement.

<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/">ITMS </a>was initially guilty by association. If you sleep with the devil, you can't really be all that good for me. Later, as netizens bemoaned the DRM issues that prevented them from using media as they wished, I took it as a sign not to bother. iPod? No thank you. At this point my PocketPC and gig SDcard are suiting quite nicely. With that, I turned my back to popularity and was essentially labeled a hipster by many associates for my refusal to go mainstream.

Well this week we've got iTunes7, And one of the things that I found most interesting about the newest incarnation of the beast is that it would allow you to get album covers from ITMS--provided that you had an account. Refusing to hold a grudge, I decided to open one and <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/mac/blog/2006/09/hazards_and_surprises_with_itu.html">see how well it did with my eclectic and very elusive music collection</a>.

I followed the create account option in the menu.
It took me to the license agreement for getting an ITMS account.....in Australia (this MAY be my fault).
I clicked the link they offered to those of us who were from a different country.
It took me to a list of permissioned countries. I chose USA (tangent: do you think Korea will ever be ITMS-friendly? ha.).
The ITMS main page USA pops up. I hunt for the signup area, settling on "account"
The popup asks for my APPLE ID. Nice! I have one of those <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/15384374/">from the battery recall</a> so I throw it in.
ERROR. My address listed is still of Daegu. And it's got credit card info.....how'd it get that?
I clear the credit card info and update the address. ERROR. No credit card info.

I don't really need to give credit card info just to sign up, do I? The cover art is free, isn't it? What's this all about? I decide that perhaps I'm at an area that is optional; after all, I was looking to create an account in the first place. Let's go back to the main page.

This time I notice the "Sign In" button in the top right. Click.
Back to the popup. But now I see there's a "Create Account" button in the bottom left. 
Back to the USA ITMS license agreement. Agree. 
Hey! they've remember my email addy and put it there for me! Nice! Add a password. Repeat.
ERROR. This email is already in use with an APPLE account. 

So I'm actually thinking to myself, "Ok, so let me use another account and open up this....wha???? All this for some CD covers? This is SO not worth the aggravation.

So I still haven't become one of the many. Curse you, iTunes.  Your forced compliance doesn't work with me. And don't get me started on your boy, iPhoto....

BODY:
I recently joined a new social network-like community called <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>. I guess I was an easy sell, as I've been looking at moblie telephony's role in society for some time now....<a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/archives/2005/12/clueless_and_co.htm">since Korea</a> at least. <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/blog/archives/2006/08/straps_as_indic.html">Points from Jan</a> were also fuel to the fire. So when I heard twitter went live, I signed up.

There was a little bit of trial and error, as Helio wasn't up on the short code, but I can confidently say that Twitter has become a routine of my day. It's interesting posting statuses (statii?) without prompting; I think it has a creative quirkiness that overrides the ego-stroking  you find in many SNSs (social networking systems). The name fits because, to be honest, there's nothing of substance there--but that doesn't stop it from becoming a complex melody of voices.

Perhaps a fitting, tongue-in-cheek slogan would be "As if you care." Not only because we're all posting little nothings about our day, but also because, for possibly the first time, I'm perfectly ok with receiving messages from people I don't know about things I have no involvement in. In fact, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/public_timeline">I look forward to it</a>. Makes  you wonder how important relevancy is to belonging. Or, conversely, how important belonging is to relevancy.

Anyway, if you're interested in twittering with me, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/leftsider">feel free</a>.

Perfect example of something that is totally normal in Korea yet virtually impossible in the United States. I noted in a comment to the blogger that in many countries people use their mobiles with the deliberate intent of avoiding interaction with others.

Can an object be both a social connector(twitter) AND a social barrier(<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/04/escapeadate_ringtone.html">escape-a-date</a>)?

BODY:
I've been talking a lot recently about people connecting, being together, being apart.....but I haven't really put my info out there so that people can be in touch with me.

So, here you go; the vehicles for my social network:

My status: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/leftsider">Twitter</a>
My thoughts: <a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider">Leftsider</a> (duh)
My music: <a href="http://last.fm/user/leftsider">Last.fm</a>
My photos: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider">Flickr</a>
My Korean side: <a href="http://www.cyworld.com/leftsider">Cyworld</a>
My links: <a href="http://del.icio.us/leftsider">del.icio.us</a>
My chat: Gtalk (can you guess my username?)

I'm still pensive about sharing MY social network systems with the public...and <a href="http://dumblittleman.blogspot.com/2006/09/how-to-get-robbed-killed-or-stalked-by.html">with just cause</a>.  But I guess I need to put my money where my mouth is...seeing as <a href="http://joi.ito.com">bigger sites</a> and more notable social web apologists are <a href="http://beta.plazes.com/user/JoiIto">doing no less</a>.

What are the elemental "sticks and glue" that make an SNS? Living beings and the things that they bond around! So the thing about social networking systems is that, in my opinion, they encompass so much more than a site you contact your friends on. SNSs have been around as long as there were people needing to connect. 

It's something you do to fit in; something you use to stay in touch. It's a social lubricant and a relationship tool. It can be a drink in a bar, a campus bulletin board, dogs sniffing each other....like I said: all you need are living beings and something that builds a bond! :)

So what makes it so dangerous online? In every SNS there is a need for a certain level of security. There are people who take advantage of the church potluck and people who manipulate through Myspace pages. In every ideal community, we encounter those who have less lofty agendas. So, we learn to act and adapt accordingly. 

So whether I'm sharing my info here, starting a business in second life, or reaching out to intelligent life in the galaxy, I do so with best intentions--despite a proven knowledge of the intentions of others--and hope to further understand the profitability and pitfalls of SNSs.

This weekend we were heading downtown to meet with some family from out of town. As we sat at a stop light, I noticed a car ahead that had an arm sticking out of the window....with a hand clutching a cellphone.

At first I thought that they were passing the phone to another car or something, but instead of passing it over, the hand raised it up, shook it around for about 5 seconds, and then pulled it back in the car.

Segue. Where do were learn how to use our mobile phones? We see people with them, the store offers them, and we buy them.  But do we actually know how and why they operate the way they do? 

When we passed the car, the woman was chatting amicably on her phone. My guess? Her understanding of how cellphones worked lead her to feel that by putting the phone in a higher, clearer area and shaking it around a bit she could "catch" some improved reception.  I chuckled at this, but how many things do we do that we have no proven basis for? Hmmm...

BODY:
In light of some of the fantastic things that I'll be wanting to discuss in the near future, I've decided it's time to shed a little more light on who I am professionally and what I do.

I currently work at the <a href="http://www.adventist.org/world_headquarters/index.html.en">General Conference</a>, the world headquarters of the <a href="http://www.adventist.org/">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a>. That would mean that yes, I am an Adventist, though that's not really something I hid in the first place. I've worked for the denominational organization for a total of about four or five years altogether; I worked here from 1999 to 2002 in generally clerical or media-related roles. My work with <a href="http://news.adventist.org/data/2002/06/1027445730/index.html.en">an international news show launch piq</a>ued my interest in international media and communication, so I decided to return to academia to gain more expertise in the area.

In 2004, my wife and I went to Korea. Mainly, we went because I was interested in Korean language--a hobby I had taken up--and because my connections with the denominational network allowed us to go as <a href="http://www.sdakorea.org/">missionaries</a> (<a href="http://www.koreasda.org/alumni/alumni.htm?page=8&keyfield=&key=">can you spot us</a>?). My wife taught while I studied. Just before we were scheduled to return, this March, I was offered a job with the organization again. With a bit of trepidation, <a href="http://70.47.137.12/leftsider/2006/05/some_of_you_may_not.htm">I accepted</a>. 

I'm working with the <a href="http://www.ministerialassociation.com/">GC Ministerial Association</a>, whose sole purpose is to be a resource of support, aid, guidance and education to pastors and church leaders. While we work very hard to provide for our own, we also provide proffesional growth training for clergy of other denominations as well. I'm involved with this aspect of our resources mainly because of my media experience; our biggest thrust in this area is an annual satellite-broadcast seminar which provides training as well as continuing education credit. If you'd like to see our most recent event, which was held here in Maryland, you can stream the Windows media file from <a href="mms://archived.hopetv.org/atn/2006-preach.wmv">here</a>. Next year's event will be in Cambridge, England.

The bulk of my work right now, however, revolves around a quarterly magazine called Elder's Digest. While the position I initially accepted was more of a lower support role (so I could focus on studies), this keeps me busy enough that they blessed me with the "Assistant Editor" title. Along with the editor, I try to make a useful, easy-to-read, objective resource for the leader who doesn't have a degree in theology, feels comfortable speaking or have all the answers for their church community. I hope to have a website up to link to in the very near future ( another think on my plate....).

At first glance it would seem that these duties have very little to do with what I'm always talking about here. However, I think that these are areas that need this kind of thinking the most. As denominational organization of over 15 million members, there needs to be an equal level of involvement, communication and awareness. Also, the structures to which I point with regularity are things I'm wondering, "Can I implement this? Could this be an asset to my religious social network?"

Because yes, religion is a <a href="http://70.47.137.12/leftsider/2006/09/my_network_vehicles.htm">social tool</a>. People gather around it, rally for or against it, live their lives by it. I've acquired a decent network of interesting individuals based on my work here, and am looking for ways that I can include even more great minds and ideas. 

I'm not an evangelist (not for religion anyway. heh) and I don't look at this website as a tool for conversion. My interest is how to connect people. It just so happens that I'd like to do that in as many areas of my living as possible. Perhaps any interest in religious beliefs, principles or explanations would be best left to another method (<a href="mailto:bryan@leftsider.com">direct communication,</a> maybe).

Ok. That long diatribe should prepare you for a few upcoming posts that, regardless of your affiliation, I hope you will find fascinating.

At the strong recommendation of <a href="http://www.kangmi.org/index/weblog/comments/oh_and_for_the_record/">Kangmi</a> and the referral of <a href="http://eflgeek.com/">EFLGeek</a> (I hope; let me know if that didn't go through), I've moved Leftsider over to <a href="http://www.site5.com/">Site5</a>. 

While <a href="http://www.fatcow.com/fatcow/index.bml">Fatcow</a> was not a bad host; I found the service to be par at best and the plans severely lacking. Every so often they're giving a way prizes for referral, but I saw very little going to improving service itself. Since opening an account with Site5 a little over a week ago, I've already received notification of <em>two</em> significant upgrades to areas of the service that already were equal or ahead of Fatcow. I also was extremely impressed that all user portals and management systems were created by Site5 specifically for Site5, with the engineers having their own blog to show progression of various projects.

Sofar the transition has been quick and relatively painless; I noticed that the prices advertised for domain processes were advantageous enough that I also gave the pinkslip to my longtime domain manager, <a href="http://www.gandi.net/">Gandi</a>, as well. This one I'm actually kinda sad about; Gandi was low-key, no-frills, but surprisingly responsive and never troublesome. I would still recommend them as the 12euro price is still not unreasonable.

Anyway, we're just waiting on the domain transfer now. Hope you'll also notice the slight improvement in the site's receptiveness as a result of the switch. Let me know if you find any problems anywhere, as I went the lazy route and just modified CSS rather than importing the old design. Thanks for you patience during the pause.

Hope you like Site5. I'm still very happy with them. 

Curiuosly, I used to be with Gandi, too, but I found their interface hard to follow (since I didn't know what I was doing, that made it even harder).

Uncanny!
They recently redesigned their site--a DRASTIC improvement. But yeah, it was definitely no-frills. If you mastered it, you deserved a medal. ^^

I can't say I ever mastered it, but at some point the clunkiness outweighed the price, so I moved on to my current registrar.

BODY:
In Asian culture (particularly "monsoon Asia" which I'm <a href="http://www.amazon.com/History-Asia-5th-Rhoads-Murphey/dp/032134054X">studying this semester</a>) there is a consistent foundation of dedication to the unit--familial, social, corporate and governmental--and its success, even at the sacrifice of personal gain. Individualism and freedom in the modern Western sense has traditionally been viewed as antisocial, selfish, and irresponsible; Everyone doing their own thing leads to chaos, where everyone pitching in for a common goal brings strength and solidarity.

Adding to this, a community-based philosophy does not seek direction from self-discovery. It instead looks to an elite or superior set of community members to set the standard for living and adherence. These people are leaders of the community and are looked to for guidance. Their status gives power but also responsibility to maintain an appearance of the ideal, to be reciprocated througout the organization. If there's a problem with the way everyone is working, theoretically it  should be traced back to the top.

Those who err face the guilt of disrespecting and sullying the unit as a whole, as all are equally involved and equally responsible for the actions of their counterparts. A sense of shame keeps these types of things to such a minimum that they are often seem blown way out of proportion when they do occur. The associations found in these systems are so tightly woven that those who abandon the unit (or <a href="http://70.47.137.12/leftsider/2005/03/theres_no_i_in_foreigner.htm">were never a part to begin with</a>) will find it incredibly <a href="http://seoulover.blogs.com/westlaw/2006/09/affiliations.html">difficult to synchronize</a>.

So why am I talking about all this? Because I couldn't help but think, as I studied this, how applicable this is to social networks. SNs do not work through individuality, but rather through tightly woven (though sometimes loosely linked) associations. <a href="http://70.47.137.12/leftsider/2006/09/digg_and_netscape_to_pay.htm">Certain people</a> maintain the status quo that is handed out to the masses. When individuals <a href="http://70.47.137.12/leftsider/2006/09/societal_meshinga_bad_thing.htm">break formation</a>, an uproar ensues, often bringing guilt and/or shame. And, finally, not being a part of the community can be quite ostracizing.

Perhaps this cultural tendency allows <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/creative_commons/">some people</a> a quicker proclivity to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">projects that draw near to these models</a>. Perhaps, this is why I may be taking my foot out of my mouth with this post as I realize that, yes, these people have been talking progressively....I've just <a href="http://70.47.137.12/leftsider/2006/08/joi_itos_web_continuous_partia.htm">been a little slow</a>. -_-;;

What do you think?

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1Tet41mhnI">This</a> is Tomoko Kawase, more commonly known these days as <a title="Artist Wiki: Tommy february6 - Last.fm" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tommy%20february6/ wiki">Tommy february6</a>. I first learned of her when watching the anime <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Kiss">Paradise Kiss</a>, which used her song "Lonely in Gorgeous" for the opening credits (they used Franz Ferdinand for the closing. Excellent!).

Hunting up info on Tommy february6, I discovered that it was her solo act after being lead singer of j-rock/alternative band <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3Ugo3XkCi0">the brilliant green</a>. A totally different sound, so I was impressed by the difference. 

But then I ran into <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwGPABuvxoY&NR">Tommy heavenly6</a>, which is Tommy february6's polar opposite/alter ego. In case you've missed it: Tomoko's solo stage character has an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9fqSW43brQ">alternate stage character</a> (It's all explained in the wiki linked earlier). Add to that the fact that the backup dancer cheerleaders in her videos, the <em>TommyAngels</em>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myrgKSdriyc&mode=related&search=">also have a video</a>....and you really are left wondering how far down the rabbit hole can go.

Is this really ok? Is it unprecedented genius? The fact that so much spawned from so little (some might argue from nothing at all, talentwise) is very interesting. How many manifestations of leftsider could I get away with? :D

<blockquote>For some, it would be unthinkable -- certain social suicide. But Gabe Henderson is finding freedom in a recent decision: He canceled his MySpace account.
No longer enthralled with the world of social networking, the 26-year-old graduate student pulled the plug after realizing that a lot of the online friends he had accumulated were really just acquaintances. He's also phasing out his profile on Facebook, a popular social networking site that, like others, allows users to create profiles, swap message and share photos -- all with the goal of expanding their circle of online friends.

Um....is going offline equivalent to shunning social networks?

I find this kinda interesting, since about 3/4 of the (black) men who approach me with amourous intent- are married themselves. 

Then again, the article doesn't say anything about whether keeping their vows was considered to be as important. Do you have a link to this article? I'd like to read the whole thing.

Ha! Well, CorporateMonkey, I guess it kinda depends where you're being approached. B'more isn't the most chivalrous city, after all....

But you make a fantastic point. Why is marriage "very important"? Is it because it's a societal norm (that can be worked around in ways you've mentioned)? Perhaps the only reason why it's important is that such a perspective is viewed as a positive trait to women.....who can know?

I'd be interested in what your reaction is to the high percentage of propositions from married men. I'd also be interested in knowing what the percentage would be for all men overall and how much higher you felt black men were prone to this situation than other ethnicities.

My reaction varies, depending on how quickly I remember to look for a ring, then follow that up with the "Are you married, do you have a girlfriend?" question. At this point, I can see in their eyes if they're answering truthfully or not.

I used to be... not flattered, but appreciative that I was receiving any attention at all. It was validation that at some point, a single guy would see all these good qualities that the  married ones did, and we'd have a perfect relationship because so many married men told me how they wished their women were more like me/ or that they'd met me sooner! It seemed like a positive endorsement. 

These are mostly men who have known me socially or through work for at least a short period of time. And from what I gather, I display personality traits or interests that their wives lack, or do not subscribe to- so I hear a lot of, "I wish my wife thought like that- you're cool!" So basically, to them, I fill that void. All the insignificant little things that bug them about their women- I am the opposite of. So I'm like 'the antidote' to all the differences they have with 'her'.

At the same time, it is a bit insulting, to consider the fact that they are propositioning me at all means that on some level, they think that there's a chance that I'll go for it- thereby helping them cheat on their wives. So really, they must not think very highly of me as a moral and respectful person, to think that I would be willing to assist them in violating the bond they have with the woman they pledged themselves to. To them, I am someone to be used for pleasure, in accordance with the 'what she doesn't know won't hurt her' guidelines, and dismissed when they feel guilty enough to stop.

As for an ethnic breakdown- can't help you there. I have been hit on/approached by black men exclusively, since 1996.

Exclusive since '96? Again...Baltimore....Heh ok I'll quit with that joke.

I'm very intrigued by the viewpoint of a woman in this instance, mainly because I have only experience it as a man. I'm married (and I actually don't wear a ring, but that's another LONG story) and I have found increasingly that women are not deterred by that fact. 

Quite probably, this may stem from the fact that a high percentage of these women are married themselves. You'd think that because of this they would know better, but instead it seems that, as a result, they know better. This makes a weak-but-well-intentioned guy like me shudder in fear. 

The other thing that intrigues me about this is the chance we hold onto a bit of naive realism about all this; Are we sure that by being propositioned people look at us as the type of person who has a lower value system? Are they even on the same value system? I once had a conversation with a guy who dated a woman and then her daughter. He said the mother was fine with it and said, "At least I know what she's getting [into]." I'm sooooo not on that value system.

If a person is on a different value system than we are, and they (and their spouse, ideally) have a differing standard placed on fidelity in marriage, would it be wrong?

<blockquote>I think the best thing you can do when you are starting out in your career is to become familiar with your natural, intuitive voice that tells you what is truth and what is crap. Passion is just an emotional byproduct of doing the right thing at the right time. Part of the struggle that peers of my generation face is that they thought they had to turn off their emotions to make it through the work day. Now they don't even know how they feel, and are walking zombies ready to explode at any minute.

There is no need to choose a "career path" that is a series of ever-ascending job titles and salary levels. That model is dead for your generation.</blockquote>

Right now, An editor of a magazine is sitting in the office of my magazine's editor.....he's trying to argue a point. I'm listening to his booming voice and I hear him say:

<blockquote>"Study after study shows that the workweek is longer in the United States than any other place in the world"</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/lab_hou_wor-labor-hours-worked">Bull-loney</a>.

How can you be an editor and say unfounded information, even if it is off the record. I don't even disagree with what he's saying, but that's horrible. Did he just make that up or something?

One thing I think that they are forgetting is that all Korean carriers give free incoming calls. All day long. That's a feature that, as I'm aware, only Nextel has ever offered.

As a result, a person on a 380-minute plan in Korea may very well need a 600-to-1000 minute plan in the US to keep from going over. And, making that comparison, the prices might be more similar.

Today my sister spent the day in the hospital, and just now has 
come out of emergency surgery.
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
It's difficult, for many reasons, to describe how and why I feel. The primary emotion is possibly mild frustration for the situation to be serious enough to warrant concern but not enough to clearly justify driving the two hours over. As it being my little sister, I am very much wanting to be by her side. For a short, routine in-and-out exploratory surgery, though, I might better save my visit for recovery time or, in a less favorable scenario, for support for a subsequent surgical need.

Which is also why I feel some moderate frustration about the lack of clear information I have about the situation. I rely on my sister to give me the closest thing to an intelligent, objective analysis of what happens back home. With her under the knife, I have to rely on opinions I haven't previously qualified, reports riddled with medical wariness, and passive responses. Fortunately I was able to get off a couple text messages to my sister, to which she replied and made me somewhat ok with not driving over.

With all the thoughts swirling in my head these days, this situation has dropped in and demanded my attention. In many ways I've got a clarity right now that I have not had for a long time. I had just settled in to some serious study when the situation became more complicated, yet, when faced with this, it became embarrasingly clear the order to which my allegiances lie. Family will <em>always</em> be first in my priorities, and the other things are just tributaries that feed into what I hope will be come a larger stream of resources to those whom I hold dear. Kim's ordeal has been a wake-up call to remember <em>why</em> all of this that I'm doing is important.

That's it. Just wanted to document my thoughts. Also, due to studying and the little worry I had, I've a bit of insomnia.

For those of you that would be interested, I will be the host of the <a title="Adventist Mission Site : Home" href="http://www.adventistmission.org/">Adventist Mission</a> special, which will be broadcast worldwide live via satellite tomorrow, at 7pm eastern time. It's not my first time hosting an event, but it is the first time I'll be in front of the camera for a televised event. I'll just be briefly on screen, but the title of host itself is pretty significant.

Unfortunately, it looks like some last minute changest have prevented this event from being adequately advertised....so I'll do my part by mentioning it here. Any questions about it, feel free to contact me.

Met my friend <a title="A couple weeks ago I (Leftsider)" href="http://70.47.137.12/leftsider/2006/05/a_couple_weeks_ago_i_1.htm">Rachel</a> on the bus and we somehow got into a very one-sided conversation.

"I think the foreigners are destroying this country," she spouted angrily, completely aware of the irony in the fact that she, herself, was a foreign resident. She complained that as the foreign population largely works in the service industry, customer relations and care were suffering considerably. 

I countered that I felt more affinity to foreigners after returnting from Korea. I looked at the ample resources and opportunities available in America, and noted that very few Americans took advantage of it; no where near the amount of foreigners that seek out success. To me, Americans are to blame for allowing foreigners to usurp our spoils. 

"But they bring the third world here," she argued. "Especially if you are a foreigner....you wouldn't believe me if I told you that service people said to me 'You're from Africa; why are you compaining about this service?' That is terrible."

Perhaps she is right. We both came to agree that no matter what side you approach it from the U.S. will not be a power above others for long. Other countries will rise and catch the stagnant power and even our global plane. She calls this degradation; I call it globalization.

What do you call it? Is it a good thing, either for America or for the world? Is is something you look forward to, or something you think needs correcting?

Hosting the first night of the Adventist Mission presentations turned out to be relatively painless. When I get a copy of the event (hopefully this week) maybe I'll put up a clip so you can see me in all my hosting glory. heh.

I actually spent a portion of Friday running around looking for a jacket to wear on stage. I haven't worn suits in a while and the ones I had weren't really bringing my <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=a-game">A-game</a> to the table. So I blew a couple hundred on a jacket, but I think I picked something that I can utilize with my wardrobe in the future.

Lots of good things to talk about regarding this weekend (except the fact that I'm working Sunday) so I'll post more soon.

BODY:
This morning I participated in a dream where I was walking down a narrow street of rowhouses, all red and blue and yellow and in good condition. I could tell that this was a very urban area, but I felt no lack of safety--it felt like a good neighborhood.

I walked out of one house and up the street to another house where my wife was. I did something there, which I can't remember, and then decided that i needed to stop back by the first house. 

On the way back, there were two people walking down the street. I moved quickly, but I saw one move in my direction to initiate contact. "Hey, do you have any change to spare?" The guy asked. 

"No, I don't carry change," I said as I paused, stopped to look at him, and shrugged. I find myself doing that often because I feel that many homeless or struggling people suffer from a deficit of attention; no one even pays them mind until they interject themselves, and then they ignore. I never carry change because I spend what's in my pockets and that's bad.

 I think he didn't anticipate me focusing on him directly because my pause caused him to overstep me and cross my path. Upon doing this, he slowed down to stay in close proximity to me.

I saw him reach for something in his pocket. He was actually fumbling around quite a bit, so I wondered what he could be pulling out....

A gun? too small.
A pack of cigarettes? possibly.
Something to or show me? It's not impossible, but I really don't have time to sit and chat. I pick up my pace.

As I overtake him, I see in the corner of my eye that it was a knife. A silver butterfly knife. I groan inwardly. Are you serious? Is this guy gonna try and stick me after I told him the honest truth? He skips a step to keep up and then he taps my arm with the blade.

"Hey," he says, half mumbling," you got any change for a knife?"

I slow down just a bit to look at him directly, but I keep moving to show him I'm not stopping for this crap and also to put me closer to my destination. "I don't keep change bro, All I have is this wallet and this phone..." 

I reach into my pockets and pull out my wallet and phone, one in each hand, raising upward as if I were going to assume a pose of surrender. But, for some reason, as soon as my hands were out of my pockets, my leg moves like a flash in a powerful attempt to kick the living daylights out of this jerk.

That was when I woke up. My leg was off the bed. Luckily for Fru, I was facing out when I lashed out--otherwise she may have acquired a really nasty bruise this morning.

It made me think though. I live my life expecting nothing but good from all people. I am not naive enough to think that there is nothing bad in the world, but I like the idea of being surprised that my fellow man has done wrong instead of being surprised that my counterpart has done something good. While this has helped me to build a positive aura around me wherever I go, it isn't a bulletproof vest.

The same is true online. We create blogs that express our ideas, make connections through social networks and internet communication tools. We live a virtual life that expects that everyone will abide by the rules. But what happens when someone doesn't?

Thinking about my dream, I realized that I reacted much more strongly that I would have anticipated. My assumption is that the fueling factor of my action was my deep deep disappointment in the choices this aggressor made. I didn't dislike him as a person, and I didn't really feel like I was preparing to fight. I just wanted to disarm him and then explain how stupid what he did was. I wanted to help him, like I feel towards all people, but there was a distinct need for a rearrangement of variables.

Is this how I would respond to a similar act in the real world? I have no clue. I do feel that my feelings in that situation, however, were indicative of my perspective on things at a subconscious level and may shed light on the foundations of my thinking. How would this translate into a response for online assault? That's what I'm thinking about now.

What they fail to mention is that 90% of Americans, given the same amount of wealth, would do the exact same thing. And of the ten percent that wouldn't, a the percentage of those whose involvement in humanitarian issues would diminish would most likely triple those whose involvement increased.

Mudslinging is dreadfully easy.

The Postwar American Suburb

Historian Robert Fishman calls American suburbia a "bourgeois utopia," whose hopes for community stability were founded "on the shifting sands of land speculation," backed up by racially discriminatory covenants and lending standards. The postwar American suburb, each a Nueva Germania of the soul, organized men's life around commutes and women's life around the home: the result was absent fathers, isolated mothers, and alienated children, who seldom knew anyone of a different race. In providing for the material needs of the growing middle class, the suburb created social and spiritual cavities that numerous social movements—from the 1960s New Left to today's Christian fundamentalism—have tried to fill.

According to census data, today the middle-income suburb is actually disappearing, drowning between the Scylla of racially exclusive gated communities and the Charybdis of ethnically diverse subdivisions. The poorest suffer from a lack of public services, lousy schools, and little in the way of parks or squares that might provide some sense of community. The most affluent suburbs are often populated by "relos," executive nomads who move every few years to keep their careers on track, never putting down roots, never investing in the community beyond the gated neighborhoods in which they own their homes. "There's no there there," said Gertrude Stein; the American suburb is still the definitive "no place," an empty parking lot sitting where our past and future should be.

Well. What can you say about this? It's increasingly apparent that <strong>social networks, when exposed to each other, will have negative impacts if only one SN's ethical code is adhered to.</strong> We've got employers reading Myspace, online RPG's potentially blackmailed, <a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2006/09/08/sex_bait.shtml">Craiglist responses put on blast</a>....each is an example of one (or more) set of understood rules being broken.

So how fragile are SN communities? Must there be a perfectly sterile environment to make these things work? Watch these stories; perhaps they will indicate how social networks will adapt and respond to these negative stimuli.

<blockquote>Microexpressions are like any other facial expression, but they are very subtle and occur incredibly quickly, coming and going in several hundred milliseconds.

Paul Ekman, largely known for his discovery that many facial expressions of emotion were universal, has been particularly keen on researching microexpressions in recent years.</blockquote>

This is an area that has always fascinated me. It's virtually impossible to completely mask your emotions simply because your body often shares more than just your planned response. Masters of deception have learned not how to hide their expressions, but how to reassign them. 

Good stuff.

Nice idea, but currently a little expensive for practical usage.

Keep me in your positive thoughts and well wishes. I'll try to keep posting as is reasonable. Until then, raid my del.icio.us?

Last night, I scanned through a copy of the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1549322,00.html">October 30 issue</a> of Time, which gave stats about America, its population, and what we think and believe. I came to realize that, if the information given was accurate, I have very little interaction with the American world at all. 

The first thing that blew my mind was that America is <a href="http://www.time.com/time/covers/20061030/who_we_are/">overwhelmingly white</a>. Now I grew up in rural america--so rural that it wasn't until going away for high school that I met an asian--but I always assumed that there were nearly as many blacks as whites, and a growing hispanic population that was preparing to surpass black is the default minority. But according to the article, whites are 80% of the nation. Amazing. 

It also said that for every 1,000 people only 455 are employed. This was stunning. less than half of the nation's inhabitants work. Now I know that this number includes children, seniors, and students, but it's still a sobering thought. Additionally, the type of major jobs people are working was significantly lower in skill than what I had anticipated.

I guess living near the nation's capital has distorted my expectations. Perhaps Washington, D.C., is a microcosm of the world--not of the United States. Either way, I'm completely floored. If I can't believe these facts about my country, how can I know the answer to questions about it's  longevity and efficiency?

And now that we're thinking, just who are the people who we connect with through social networks? Are they the high end of the scale, rather than the average joe? Are their visions indicative of the masses? Are their views even relevant to the masses? As a humorous aside, this would explain to me the popularity of MySpace.....:P

Just the other day I was thinking about myself (particularly some of the opportunities I've recently been given to be closer to the spotlight) and wondered if I was getting just a little overvalued in my own mind. I, the person still in school, still working jobs that I can just barely tolerate, spouting of things that I think sound visionary--am I just fooling myself into ego-stroking? Now, with this information, I wonder whether what I say even matters anymore. And if it does, just how much further ahead are the leaders of the pack?

I think it is a general mistake for people to value themselves. We are not objective in our self-assesments, so we cannot be fair in valuation. Additionally, as we will never come to ourselves for goods and services, we have a disconnect from the social demand that we are supplying. Our value should be based on what we contribute to our community, now how highly we feel about ourselves.

Just for clarification, this is completely different from self-worth. This is what you can determine. What I'm speaking of in this instance is my validity to the people around me.

I also heard this on NPR the other day...I wonder how pessimistic the study actually is.
<blockquote>A new study shows that the oceans' fish are being depleted so fast that eating seafood might be just a memory in 40 years. The researchers say more is at stake than our diet, for they find the dwindling of fish stocks hurts the world economically and the ocean environmentally. Researchers say it is not too late to reverse the trend.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Stacked up against teaching technology, foreign languages and the material on standardized tests, penmanship instruction seems a relic, teachers across the region say. But academics who specialize in writing acquisition argue that it's important cognitively, pointing to research that shows children without proficient handwriting skills produce simpler, shorter compositions, from the earliest grades.

Scholars who study original documents say the demise of handwriting will diminish the power and accuracy of future historical research. And others simply lament the loss of handwritten communication for its beauty, individualism and intimacy.</blockquote>

I used to often say that if I were kind of the world, I would do everything digitally and use paper only for calligraphy, poetry, music writing, and such. While I recognized the romance inherent in hand-writing, I didn't associate it completely with creative thought.

Just last week one of the associate directors noted (very audibly) my handwriting during a staff meeting. I was fortunate enough (though at the time felt quite UNfortunate) to attend a elementary school that focused considerably on handwriting. During my formative years, handwriting and oration were really force-fed to us, and most of the people who did well in those area did seem to excel more in their studies overall.

Are we losing a cultural and expressive treasure as we hurtle headlong into technological efficiency? There have been arguments in China regarding the losses incurred from the adoption of simplified Chinese; there have been laments in Korea about the declination of literacy due to less Chinese character usage and unchecked adoption of foreign words. Could this be America's equivalent?

Coincidentally, I think this really fits with the cute post below.

It's an irony that the World Handwriting Contest has what is possibly the world's worst contest website, complete with tiling background image, bad links and the page that just won't quit.

Even so, I looked through the entries. Some of them are simply fantastic. I think, with a little refreshing, I could compete, though.

As my <a title="Living Single (Leftsider)" href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/10/living_single.htm">"Living Single"</a> post has veered to a slightly different topic in the comments, I thought I'd reincarnate it with another topic I've been discussing recently. 

Apparently it's put Bryan on blast season, because this story again involves someone <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/09/double_placebo.htm">calling me out very audibly in public</a>. At lunch, an acquaintance asked me, "Why don't you wear a wedding band?" When I gave her my answer, she said. "I don't buy that. You need to get a ring."

At this point, the entire table erupted in a debate as to whether or not the wedding band was a must for fidelity. Advocates said that it indicated how to approach a person and what to expect from them. <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5359395/site/newsweek">Naysayers</a> rebutted that it was a cultural traditional effect, and thereby had no true attachment to universal truth or, in this instance, faithfulness.

In all the clamor (I eat lunch with a rowdy bunch) I really wasn't asked my input, ironically. For what it's worth, I feel that every person should be able to approach a person in a way that is perfectly amicable but is in no way disrespectful of their marital status. If a ring determines your behaviour then I feel you have control issues. <strong>Your behaviour and interaction with others should be <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5359377/site/newsweek/">deliberately determined by YOU</a>.</strong>

This is particularly my opinion when I interact with singles who have a lack of regard for the wedding band and marital status. These people are not bad or wrong, nor are they demeaning or insulting; I pity these people in most cases for adhering to primal urges rather than higher reason. The reason <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/10/living_single.htm#comment-71">I feel weak in these situations</a> is because I have an innate sense of manipulation; I make an effort  to not take advantage of people that don't have the same level of information. In fact, my whole fascination with social networks may stem from the fact that it very often allows people to live in a society where information is available to all--making a more level playing field.

On the other side, of which I've only become aware through the recent commenting, I'm ashamed of married people who prey on naivete. However, I'm not sure how I feel about married-to-married, though. <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/15432406.htm">Who's fooling who</a>?

In other cultures, where mistresses are tolerated, or polygamy practiced, or where marital bonds are shunned, do my philosophies still stand? Do yours? Is there a universal rule that can keep you safe in any environment?

It is with increasing concern that I've noticed the disassociation that people have with their world. 

Tonight, I picked up some blowing across my apartment community's lawn. I passed initially, but turned around to get it. I felt a social responsibility to my neighbors and a fondness for the general upkeep of my complex that was greater than the inconvenience of picking up trash that was not mine. It's not the greatest gesture in the world, and I'd like to think that other would people would do it as well.

Unfortunately, I know this is not the case. In fact, the last time I did this, it was picking up a half-full Coke bottle that stayed in the parking lot a few days. Wait, no; the last time I did it was picking up a bag floating around where the kids play soccer and tag. Why would trash persist, especially in a high-traffic area of a somewhat closed community?

Refuse is not the only example. My church is facing problems of a similar ilk. A few leaders have left for other opportunites and have their fans have followed. Our church budget, dependent upon contribution by a certain number of members, has suffered. But, instead of filling the void and picking up the slack, many have complained about the lack of service being offered and have looked at the weakening budget as an indication that it's time to look elswhere.

Since when has the world become a self-serving, parasitical place? Are we not equally responsible for the fate of our environment, the state of our institutions, and the needs of our communities? Since when did it become a good idea to move out of the city to escape the crime, rather than work on the factors that incite criminal behaviour? Since when did it make more sense to live isolated than to die fighting for equality and civil justice? 

Have we become this bankrupt? Can social networks affect this? Positively or negatively? Where is the root of this moral decay?

<blockquote>The Washington Post has a brief article called "Why Everyone You Know Thinks The Same As You". In short, you hang out with people who are like you, a phenomenon known as homophily. This happens online, and indeed the Internet can lower the costs of finding people like you. But homophily raises the question for social software designers of how much they should encourage homophily and how much they want to mix it up.</blockquote>

Good topic, but an unfortunately flat post. What are the benefits and dangers of homophily in social networks?

A recent biology professor related a story about cheetahs that I often use to flesh out this point. Skipping the fascinating way in which it was discovered, basically scientists have discovered that all cheethas living today have an identical genetic makeup. At some point, their numbers were reduced almost extinction, and their gene pool, as a result, was severely reduced. With only a few cheetahs left to mate, and then the subsequent inbreeding that occured, it basically ensured that these cats would have very little difference.

The consequence of this, however, is that any virus or bacteria that is lethal to one cat will be lethal to all. <strong>There is no survival of the fittest in the extreme case of homophily; all share the same strengths--and the same vulnerabilities.</strong>

What the article refers to as serendipity (I'm not averse to that titling, but I tend to think that the benefits may be acquired <em>without</em> realization) does make it a more arduous task to <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/05/a_couple_weeks_ago_i_1.htm">retain our identity</a>, but with that diversity we receive a more robust foundation for strength and growth. The same biology professor humorously noted that mutts tend to be the most resilient dogs--and this may, among other things, be a result of their genetic breadth.

How can we improve our serendipity online? What happens to our perspective when we <a href="http://theassimilatednegro.blogspot.com/">pick one topic and cater exclusively to that audience</a>? Or when we collect a variety of ideas under one common cause? How often do we really try to think, let alone use the web, in a way that is <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/blog/archives/2006/10/connecting_the.html">other than who we are</a>? Can a social network connect like-minded individuals while still providing the spice of life that variety contains?

BODY:
I experienced a good bit of mental trauma coming back to the US. I was talking with a friend recently and he noted that my philosophies have changed considerably in the past two years. Now that the dust has settled, I'm starting to realize it myself.

<strong>Socialism vs. Capitalism in the western world.</strong> Before I left, this friend and I were on opposite sides of this topic's spectrum. He believed in a more socialist society. I didn't deny the merit of such a scenario, but noted that it was a theory that required total adherence. Just one person who seeks his own over others could potentially throw the whole thing off--which, I argued, is why there are no successful examples of such a society today. Man is, by nature, a capitalist; therefore it is only this way that can be realistically prescribed.
Now, I still thing that socialist theories are well intentioned but ultimately flawed, and for much the same reason that I did before. However, I no longer think that man is capitalist by nature. Instead, I feel that most people are in a self-induced coma. In this coma, you are not expected to do, feel, think, or act in any way other than what the coma prescribes. The machine moves so smoothly--so efficiently--that it really is more effort to live deliberately. The mass of the population lives to exist as part of the mass, with most people completely unaware of exactly how much choice exists in their life. Of the few who do realize, many choose not to decide to avoid a life of redundant explanation and ostracized social friction. It's all very <a href="http://www.nocents.org/images/featurepics/MatrixArticleImage2.jpg">Matrix-like</a>.
The remaining people--those who realize their ability to live different and choose to do so--are responsible for the direction and provision of structure for the rest of society. Most of these people use this to their own gain and profit; hence, capitalism. I like to think that making people aware of their dormancy should be a requirement; if you choose to avoid deliberacy, however, I feel no guilt providing the services to supply your demand. 
Still pro-capitalism, but from a decidedly different perspective. This is the view that prompted him to express how I've changed.

<strong>Status, Automobiles.</strong> Recently I had a friend who complained to me how he had been hoodwinked by his wife and, as a result, was the proud owner of a BMW X5. He is a BMW enthusiast, but he felt it was unnecessary to take on the payments when his current vehicle was paid for and drove just fine. Less than six months later, however, he is the proud owner of a Porsche Boxster. 
To be honest, I love cars as a status symbol. When I arrive, I want to have a car that lets people know such. Because I feel that all of your things should be indicative of who you are (not who you're aspiring to be), I can't justify a status-symbol car at this point in my life. In fact, the beat-up <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/277261493/">car I currently own</a> is probably quite indicative of my life right now. ha. 
For economical reasons, I am more in favor of public transportation than private, which means that outside of the status symbol realm, a car is largely excessive to me; an expensive car, even more so. As I currently feel that <a href="http://www.leaseguide.com/lease03.htm">I will never own another car for the rest of my life</a>, I cannot help but feel a tinge of sadness that all of these philosophies show how much the paths of my friend and I have diverged.

<strong>Thinking about you thinking about me.</strong> I had some very fun times in my life, and I sort of built a reputation of being a very fortunate fellow. In fact, I was fortunate--perhaps downright lucky--but because of this my life revolved around spin. I knew about <a href="http://www.wallpaper.com/">luxurious things I couldn't afford, places I'd never been to</a>, and made acquaintance with people who were largely out of my league. I had to, in order to maintain my good standing and reputation. It wasn't a bad thing, because I learned so much and enjoyed every minute of it; but as I prepared to really pursue the school thing and go abroad, I found myself retelling the same stories....because my self-extraction from the spin left me with only the inertia to work with.
Today, I'm in contact with very few of my old friends. I'm in little contact with anyone, really, as I focus on work and school. But I'm building spin again. This time, it's self-created; it's the culmination of the ideas I'm brewing, the new things I'm learning, and the application of any(and every-)thing to practical life. Think tanks are du jour; speaking engagements are becoming more common. this time, I'm really looking to move the world and build my reputation on function rather than form.

I feel as if these and other changes are a move forward; I love the idea of being progressive, and I don't want to rest on my current laurels. I want to move forward and see, do, and be more. And like they say: Change is good.

<blockquote>Black men made large gains in employment during the economic boom between 1996 and 2000, increasing their employment rate by 2.4 percent compared with a 1.5 percent increase overall. But they lost more ground than the rest of the workforce between 2001 and 2006, falling 3 percent compared with a 1.2 percent decline among all workers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>CAPTCHAs are the boxes of distorted text that you are asked to identify when you enter data or register with some websites. There's an example on the left. The idea is that they prevent automated sign-ups and spamming because it is relatively easy for humans to identify the distorted letters, but beyond the capabilities of most software.

Rogue advertising is big business on the net, and CAPTCHAs have become a significant barrier for people who rely on spam to make a quick buck selling dodgy Viagra, penis enlargement pills or grey-market imports. One way of getting round such security measures would be to enlist large numbers of people who type in the solutions. This is where the naked naked celebrities come in.

According to news reports, porn sites have been set up which require the user to solve a CAPTCHA to view the content. The CAPTCHAs, of course, are taken from other websites, and every user who provides the correct answer in their bid to see naked flesh also opens a door for spammers to automatically register another account or post another advert.</blockquote>

Just one example of how easy it can be to use the general population  as a means for questionable ends.

When I was a child, we were still in the era of "speak when spoken to." From my parents, I'd expect a sharp look that signaled that my mouth was leading me into imminent danger. Then I'd be told to go play in another room or something. This was fortunate, since I knew plenty of kids who would have instead just received a swift backhand.

By the end of my youth, however, I already noticed a greater tolerance for loose-lipped juveniles. Perhaps as a result of the "Kids Say the Darnedest Things" mentality, people actually smiled when kids made off-color comments.  It is to this faltering stance that I pin the blame for bad, mouthy kids. 

Yes, I'm a 27 year-old fogey.

<blockquote>And as for competing against Apple? BitTorrent’s strength is that it can offer formats for all devices. He predicts a backlash against Apple’s ‘locked-in’ ecosystem in the next three years. “Apple is a phenomenal company - we’ve hired engineers from Apple and know the calibre of the talent and creativity. Fundamentally Steve Jobs has challenged an entire value chain, whether it’s publishers or the consumer electronics industry. But Apple is only as good as the weakest link because that’s all forged and locked in together. If people stopped wanting iPods because a better piece of hardware came along, the whole thing would fall apart.</blockquote>

Skip the rest of this article unless you are particularly interested--this is all you really need to look at. I can't tell ypu how many people have scowled at my disdain for iPods and ITMS in general. But if they think about it, this statement should shut them up real quick.

<blockquote>A couple months ago, Jim jokingly asked me, "Why don't you ever write about me on your site?" That surprised me and I thought about it for a while. Too often, personal-finance blogs berate people for failing to plan and manage every aspect of their financial future, or only focus on the outlier issues. It's easy to spend every day writing about the things that we're not doing, and I think I've fallen into that trap a little bit. But I want to celebrate the people who have taken the time to set up their accounts right, thought hard about investing and saving, and created an infrastructure so that it actually gets easier over time. That's rich.</blockquote>

Cute. I wish I had time on my hands to live frivolously like this. Actually, I'd just settle for the S4. :)

<blockquote>The amount corresponds to a staggering 1.9 percent of Korea’s GDP of W806.6 trillion, and 47.5 percent of the W30.1 trillion budget for education. But despite that, Koreans’ command of the English language remains quite poor, the report says. The Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development ranked Koreans’ English skills 35th out of 61 countries. The Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC), which offers information on the business environment in East Asia, pointed to Korea as the country where English communication is the most difficult among 12 Asian nations.</blockquote>

There is so much I could say about this...but I think instead I'm just going to do something about it.

BODY:
Today Fru prepared a very light meal. It was delicious and fairly healthy; I was completely satisfied. Most people I know would not have been satisfied by its size, and that got me thinking: Why do people in America eat so much?

The first thing I thought of is the stereotypical overpriced restaurant where you get a big plate with an exquisitely arranged, tiny bit of food. I've had this before; it's good because that dish is just a course and you'll probably be satisfied once all courses have been served. Rich people have it right; eat small portions of good things to satisfaction rather than large portions of anything to fill.

Why do we, being non-affluent, stuff ourselves? Naturally(?), this made me think of  overpopulation in Asia. Actually I just had my Asian Studies final, where overpopulation is discussed. You see, the main reason why people have so many children is 1)personal security and 2)lack of education. In less-developed countries, more children mean more workers--which is equivalent to greater profit. Additionally, you can rely upon your children to provide for you when you are no longer physically able to continue in your hard labor. In countries where the emphasis has transferred from agriculture to technology, there is a marked decrease in offspring; It's perfectly normal for a professional couple in the US to opt for no children at all, relying upon their investments and other things for security.

Perhaps, I theorized while Fru listened, our food intake is similarly aligned. People who are materially poor visualize material excess as more food than you can eat. Conversely, I think that most rich people would not even have food on the list of things that symbolize wealth. So those of us from more modest backgrounds look at eating in a way that is indicative of the mentality from which we are raised. <strong>It therefore becomes a conscious decision for us to live like we want, rather than like the sum of our upbringing.</strong>

How many things in life to we really do out of our own inclination and not as a reaction of who we are? Should we be living our lives any differently?

<blockquote>Mobile phone manufacturers are a lot like... hibiscus leaves? Hotel chains? Umm.. zoo animals! Sure! Nokia is like a cotton-topped tamarin, all preened and fancy and slick, but yet there's something about them makes you want to punch them in the face. Motorola's phones are like an giraffe, sleek and impressive from a distance, but rough, gangly, and awkward up close, and then they honk and spit garbage on your pants. Samsung is like a dromedary camel... oh, for goodness sakes, this is terrible.

Here's what I'm trying to say. Until Apple becomes the Apple of Mobile Phones, we have Sony Ericsson. </blockquote>

Oh my goofy gulai is he right. My classmate has this phone and I nearly creamed in my pants. I know that is so totally offensive as that it would never be on this site....but that's really how I felt. Like it was something sexual. This is the first cellphone envy I've felt since I returned from Korea....and boy did it hit me hard.

How do we define truth? In an overwhelming amount of situations, we observe truth only in the perspectives that are natural to us. This is not unusual; after all, <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/11/network_disconnect.htm">how can you view something from a perspective that you do not know</a>?

This idea alone is enough to interest me in lifetime of discovery and exploration. <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2005/08/combating_stupidity.htm">My world is one-dimensional</a> until I view it from the position of another. My truth, indeed, lies flat until viewed from all sides. This is important because only through this process can we separate truth from tradition.

This is an idea that has fascinated me for sometime now. I first noticed it when I travelled to Tanzania in 2001. During my stay I discovered that the format of church worship in Christian churches was much the same as it was in North America. Order of the service, style of the building of worship, even dress in many cases was identical to an old-school, conservative church. 

While it was comforting to find something that was similar to my style of living, I realized almost immediately that this format had little to no relevance in the everyday lives of the people. The contrast between their weekday and their day of Christian worship was like <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/02/flickrphoto_border_solid_28.htm">night and day</a>. How could these people understand a God who was supposed to be a daily companion and provider if the only way they knew to be in touch with him was through a foreign module? Could they have been given a new religion that was not so entwined with geographical tradition?

For a long time, I thought about the division of truth and tradition. Specifically, I examined my religious principles. But, eventually, this koan of sorts has permeated into my entire life philosophy. Questions of what I study, who I admire, where I live, how I commute and even the purpose of this site have been re-processed through this intellectual strainer, in hopes of a more refined, less defaulted lifestyle. 

I believe that life should be deliberate. You are not required to deliberate upon tradition; rather, <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/11/quote_of_the_day.htm">it completely allows you to be free of any responsibility</a> to assessing and validating your course. Of course you can <em>choose</em> to follow tradition, but few people do that. It's quite often a choice unmade; a default instituted.

In a statement, to live is a completely and markedly different experience than to exist. Which experience allows you a better opportunity to understand truth more fully?

The other day I was harranguing a friend about a number of irrelevant issues and happened to mention that all these things would make much more sense if he simply read this blog. He replied that he had visited occasionally but that "there was nothing there." More precisely, he had no idea what I was talking about here.

Good point. I've been maintaining Leftsider with varying consistency for over five years now. The site has had numerous faces, and locations, so I'm sure that it's not an exaggeration to say that the topics have changed as well. Even a year ago my topics were mainly about Korea, which has a much smaller part of the picture today. 

So what is Leftsider about right now? Well, my best explanation would be that this blog looks at the history of culture and the future of technology to create a practical philosophy for the present. More than ever, I find that looking at things that have happened around the world give me insight as to what is happening here. And if I follow technology to the future world, I want to have that same human, native, personal practicality to go with it. It covers a lot, but then, how much of a perspective would it be if it wasn't?

So now we've labeled it. Hope you'll find the ride less confusing from here on out.

It's great to have good parents, and it's even more applaudable when you can do something similar for those whom you will help to grow. What does it mean for a society when parents no longer look for ways to help their children through their problems? Are we not seeing the effects of this now?

This was written so well, so succinctly, I was tempted to get all emotional about it. I should call my folks and thank them for taking an interest in me.

<blockquote>"The FBI can access cell phones and modify them remotely without ever having to physically handle them," James Atkinson, a counterintelligence security consultant, told ABC News.  "Any recently manufactured cell phone has a built-in tracking device, which can allow eavesdroppers to pinpoint someone's location to within just a few feet," he added.</blockquote>
I know that there have been some regulations to standardize GPS or some other tracking requirements for mobile phones...they've been talking about that for years. 

But if it is useful to this degree of reconnaissance, why were we unsuccessful with the Kim family and the hikers recently? To what extent do we effectively use technology, and who decides in which direction a technology is applied?

Also <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16081654/">here</a>. I really hope that this is something that will produce favorable results. I really would make a man like me hang up much of his pirating days if this were to happen.

There are others who say it much more poignantly than I can. But the fact remains: I'd consider even paying $100 a month for access to an unlimited database of unrestricted music from the major labels.  Think audio-on-demand on your DAP, your mobile device, your home stereo, or your satellite-enabled car radio. It'd be well worth it.

Any reason why that wouldn't work? And isn't the plural for mp3 still mp3?

Taking some time off has been really interesting. In a sense, I feel relief from the pressures of work and school (and web, honestly). On the other hand, I've felt as if I've not been making any gains--personal progress--as well. As such, my vacation has felt a lot like the break you get when you take the elevator instead of the stairs (you do take the stairs, don't you?).

I've managed to whittle down my RSS feeds to a point where I'm two weeks behind now. I intended to tackle this while on holiday in <a href="http://www.43places.com/places/view/106688">Chicago</a>, but internet access....well, you can ask your brother-in-law for the password for his wireless network, but I dare say you're overstepping your boundaries when you ask permission to reset his router since the password is obviously incorrect. I'd suggest doing something else like...reading my next post. :)

I had the opportunity to play with this (and office 2007! wow!) last week and I was just floored. Despite the fact that it's late, it's feature-stripped, and, well, it's Microsoft, this is a BEAST of an OS. 

Unless those things that Jobs "kept secret" about Lepoard are really, really, fantastic (note to self: why haven't I played with lepoard yet?), I see Vista and Lepoard to be largely on the same playing field. 

This really makes no difference however. I still say buy a mac. Hardware supports both OS, and both Apple and MS will say "Thanks for buying!" It's a win-win-win(you) situation.

<blockquote>The world's cities are getting taller – and fast. Between 2001 and 2012, almost as many skyscrapers will be constructed as were built in the entire 20th century.</blockquote>

Makes sense to me. Why sprawl when you can climb? A recent conversation that I had with a friend, however, pointed out one drawback to my recent promotion of urban living; pollution. 

While I haven't any indication that pollution per person increases in an urban setting, it is more concentrated due to the density of the population. This is evidenced by the cloud of smog that is present over many major cities. He noted that even 20 years ago in New York if you left the window open you'd find a layer of dust/soot/something covering your household items. Tasty. 

What solutions do we have for pollution in highly concentrated areas? anyone know?

Why stick the cost to the airline or airport? Add the dime to the cost of the luggage, with the RFID tag placed in a damage-resistant, universal location. 

There is no need for the manufacturer--or the purchaser, for that matter--to ever know the number so it would never be a privacy/tracking issue. As long as the numbers assigned are unique enough that two bags won't have the same number in a random airport, I think that would be problem solved. What do you think?

Newly introduced to this blog. It's very well written, but I'm not really supportive of the department store philosophy--however it manifests itself. 

I started shopping the more boutique-styled stores because you could follow a brand or style that you love (essentially <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/blog/archives/2006/12/post_161.html">filtering your clothing options</a>), paying, arguably, more for <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/archives/2006/09/stop_being_cheap_and_go_buy_so.html">what you value</a>. When Banana Republic got over their Safari outfit style (basically when they were bought out by Gap) I was a walking advertisement. Later I added even trendier lines like French Connection and Club Monaco. 

I stopped being a BR posterboy when everyone else looked like a BR posterperson. What was the point? Increasingly I realized that the entire setup was to give style to those who inherently didn't have it (like me) instead of encouraging people to make their own style. This is why it is so simple to run into a BR/JCrew/Gap and come out with an outfit--they make everything as compatible as possible so that you can have a good look without actually trying. 

Vintage was the next logical step. I'm horrible at shopping for vintage and for good reason. Cheaper, less focused stores like H&M allow me to cover my vintage faux pas with a retro uncoordinated coordination. This is essentially spending money to look like a cross between a <a href="http://thesartorialist.blogspot.com/2006/11/on-streetperfect-part-2-manhattan.html">hobo</a> and a graphic design student (see <a href="http://www.hel-looks.com/">here</a> for a stereotypical association!).

I love this new style because it allows a conglomeration of new, old, mainstream and eclectic into a statement that defines you at the precise moment that you chose it! Just when fashion was about to truly become a networking vehicle (for fabric?)....here come the big guys again, scooping up whats hot from any brand and telling you how to achieve the disheveled look du jour. While I agree that it is the path that they needed to take to survive, did they really need to survive? I find it akin to a major television network scouring youtube, metacafe, etc., to offer you programming. While it might allow them to give more of what you want, isn't there an unnecessary step there? 

Where does convenience begin to beget conformity? Can this conformity vehicle be beneficial (changing the stagnation of boutique stores, etc)? How many times can one person say "meaning management" in one post? 

All very intriguing questions.

We weren't trying to honor the man, the country, or U.S. interventionism. Rather, we were trying to let a bruised and hard-to-defend moment of American history have a rare moment as a costume.</blockquote>

With an opening paragraph like this, you either turn off immediately or turn the ol' intellect up a notch and get ready for a good one. I mean honestly, who dresses up for halloween as a war?

If I may (I mean, it's my blog, for pete's sake) I'd recommend the latter. Definitely a good read.

<blockquote>Still, nobody has yet come up with a wholly persuasive explanation for what has caused the new inequality. Education is still a big part of the overall picture. Beyond education, it’s possible that social mores have changed to make huge salaries for chief executives and other top earners more acceptable. It’s also possible that the new inequality is a natural outgrowth of what Robert Frank, a Cornell professor, has called the “winner-take-all society,” in which globalization and technology have raised the relative value of the very highest paid jobs. Or it’s possible that the rightward drift of government policy over the last generation — deregulation and falling tax rates, for example — has somehow enabled the rich to gain at everyone else’s expense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Why do people love U.S. soaps so much? It is mainly because they offer something different from the familiar fare of domestically produced dramas. The Chosun Ilbo asked translators of subtitles of U.S. dramas to compare shows produced in the two countries.</blockquote>

My favorite part of this article is where they consider their dependence upon in curable diseases as a benefit over U.S. dramas. Actually, this is the one thing that all purveyors of K-Drama can agree to, though perhaps for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81CtnGNCXhk">different reasons</a>. :)

<blockquote>DCA can cause pain, numbness and gait disturbances in some patients, but this may be a price worth paying if it turns out to be effective against all cancers. The next step is to run clinical trials of DCA in people with cancer. These may have to be funded by charities, universities and governments: pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to pay because they can’t make money on unpatented medicines. The pay-off is that if DCA does work, it will be easy to manufacture and dirt cheap.</blockquote>

There are a lot of things I find interesting about this. It's possible that you would have to use this drug for an extended period of time--perhaps indefinitely. Would a lifetime of pain be worth delaying death? Also very sad to be reminded of how little pharmaceutical companies are interested in helping heal. But I shouldn't be surprised, right? <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/01/how_to_kill_a_personality.htm">A company is a company</a>, remember that.

<blockquote>Mr Johnson wants schools to use the wealth of museums, art galleries and outdoor education centres on their doorsteps and further afield to inspire and motivate pupils.

"Learning outside the classroom should be at the heart of schools' curriculums and ethos," he said.

"Children can gain valuable learning experiences, from going on cultural visits overseas to teachers simply using their school grounds imaginatively.

"Educational visits and out-of-school teaching can bring learning to life by deepening young people's understanding of the environment, history and culture and improving their personal development."</blockquote>

Too bad this guy isn't in the United States. I was talking with a coworker today who said that no international organization should have a North American as CEO if they really want to have an international perspective and direction. While I think this may be a stretch, it is much more likely for a non-American to have experience multiple cultures firsthand. What can we do to change that?

<blockquote>A survey found 43% of online networkers from the US felt "as strongly" about their web community as they did about their real-world friends.

It also revealed net-users had made an average of 4.6 virtual pals this year.</blockquote>

I'm not surprised. It would seem that I do make more online acquaintances than real-world ones, but that's largely because the internet is my primary recreational outlet. 

I remember my first real online friend. I met her in a MUsh (remember those?) and for some strange reason we chatted it up. In the first conversation she asked me, "Are you gay???" which was not so shocking considering our first conversation largely revolved around musicals. We said a lot of silly things and that was that.

We got to a point with the silly conversations that we basically roamed the MUsh as a duo. Talked increasingly about more serious, real-world stuff as well. Ultimately, we talked at least every weekday, no exceptions. When I made my very first blog, I asked her to collab with me and we did so for quite a while.

Ultimately she went off to do the LiveJournal thing and I incorporated the blog format in my personal site, creating what is now leftsider. We kept in touch for years; she frantically contacted me to see if I was ok during 9/11(I was); I spent hours and hours lending an ear and opinion on rocky relationships (which ultimately turned out better than I predicted, apparently). I don't really keep in touch now, but I do drop in and see what's new on <a href="http://www.winstonlf.com/">her site</a> periodically.

Online relationships have often been touted as a pure form. There is only the mind to understand; peers, appearance, and socio-cultural differences are largely made irrelevant. What can we learn from online relationships that can be translated into our real-world relations? Is there anything that should be added to our online relationships to make them more relevant and publically viable?

It takes a lot of work to make something successful. And when you want to set it free you have a lot of anticipation. The problem is that the ones who oversee it after you step back rarely have the same care and concern as you. Quite often, they're also more interested in gain than progress. This is why things like this happen to all of us. I sincerely wish it wouldn't.

This guy is incredible. He's a real inspiration by the way he is able to simply and effectively reinforce a single theme: You are responsible for your financial environment, and doing so does not need to be exceedingly complex. It only needs to be deliberate.

I've been going on for the past two weeks in conversational ramblings that have revolved around a few key words: deliberacy, perception, and purpose. How many of us really live are lives in a way that can truly incorporate these ideals? If so, we'd find as Ramit has that there everything about living is connected and reference-capable.

Anyway, he's got a little booklet he's selling. I might just buy it as paybacks for all the information he's given thus far. Definitely worth checking.

<blockquote>There must be some lesson to be learned here, about the telephone game. Or about how the fact that any of us can be quoted out of context as public figures at virtually any time. But what I see right now is the depressing reality that everybody can be completely reasonable, and the end result is that nobody is allowed to show the most engaging, interesting and unique parts of their personality. </blockquote>

I can see both sides of the fence here. On one side, a person is dulled down to something nondescript in order to be a representative face of a company, its employees and investors. He loses self in order to speak for many, and that seems to be a loss.

On the other hand, he is speaking for an organization. The organization is an entity, not a spirit or a living thing. It has no characteristics. It cannot emit emotion of any kind. As such, any ideas you have about the personality of a company are solely based upon the personalities of the people you identify as that company. Microsoft is bad because you don't like Bill Gates. Apple is aesthetically inclined and somewhat snobbish. Enron is scandalous. 

No, No, No. All companies listed are simply that--companies. They provide services for a price and generate profit. They are machines. They have no soul, no right/wrong mechanisms. They are no more personable than your toaster is sweet. So any personality or flair that a CEO or PR person shows that endears or repulses you is false if you apply it to the company. 

In the case of this CEO, his comments were pertinent. I don't buy the <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/01/02/that_personalit">spin that Anil later reports of</a>. What he said was accurate, and it revealed a way of thinking in an informal and unpolished manner. If he gets heat for it, he deserves it. When on the record, you speak for your company; not for yourself. This is important for all of us to remember.

I've been spending a significant amount of time in the dental office recently. Nothing too bad, but because I've been without a dentist for about 3-4 years, it definitely was overdue.

I've decided that I probably would not make a good dentist or dental hygienist. The primary reason is because of my attention to detail. I love making things just right, and it would seem to be a problem if my patients had to endure me an extra 30 minutes so that I could perfect what was already just fine. Imagine their horror as I place sharp, pointy objects in their mouth and strive for the pinnacle of dental repair. 

Speaking of focus and diligence, I was fascinated by how quickly I became a non-person once in the chair. As my hygienist received me we chatted amicably, cracking jokes and talking intelligently. Once my mouth opened, however, I became a task--an assignment. I guess it helps that you're unable to talk while someone's hands are in your mouth, but what I initially thought was a glaze-over what actually an acute focus of attention to work. Dental practitioners pore over their work in the same way that a surgeon does, or an engineer, or a top-notch college student. Or an honest cubicle drone, for that matter.

Questions from these visits: At what point does excellent work cross the line into <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/sfo/80520208.html">painful precision</a>? What are the rules of social interaction when you are a non-person? Not only in the chair at the dental office, but at the massage parlor, the shoe store, the makeup counter. Do we ever put those who work for us in a non-person role? The bus boy, the bus driver, the cashier?

Re: non-persons: it's obviously a very uncomfortable issue for a lot of people, but I think you're getting at something which is critical to service design, and too rarely acknowledged let alone faced. I've thought about it a little bit in the context of hotels.

In service design, the non-person is essential to allow the customer detachment from the sobering details of what they are requesting. Unfortunately, it would seem that in many service areas this balance is taken for granted by the recipient and under-utilized by the service provider. It is, however, a known--especially for those who find themselves partaking in activities on a side that is different from their norm (affluent kid living in the slums through college, successful prodigy revisiting family and humble roots).

What fascinated me most about this encounter, however, was that it seemed that I, the service  recipient was the one who became the non-person. Despite my efforts at apparel, educated wit and charm, I was reduced to 32 teeth, all carrying their own individual character and flair. 

While unnerving, I think it was ideal. I would rather become a non-person to receive good service than to be pampered and wooed with no real attention to the quality being given. Perhaps this also ties into service design; would I rather receive a king's welcome or service fit for one?

La casa 20x20 es el resultado de la exploración de un módulo cuadrado referido por un material y sometido a prueba mediante un programa. El proceso se inició mediante la elección del revestimiento: cerámica 20x20. Luego se generó tres condiciones: Primero, toda la casa debía estar dividida en módulos perfectos de 20 centímetros. En segundo lugar, todos los recintos, vanos, muebles, iluminación, etc. estarían referidos a una trama de 20x20 centímetros que operaría como plano regulador tanto dentro como afuera de la casa. Y por último, la casa debía tener una planta cuadrada. Esto último, por tratarse de un ejercicio que en parte opera bajo la idea de esquematización del espacio y su consecuencia de la referencia directa con las proporciones del material.</blockquote>

Is this my first post in spanish? hmm...Just today one of my neighbors was shocked when I spoke spanish to her. I explained that my mother is Costarricense. Now I expect she'll try to talk to me only in spanish, and I'll suffer.

Back at the topic. this is an article (with lots of pictures, non-linguists) about a modern-styled modular house which is completely open on three sides (glass walls) and completely closed on the fourth. 

Beautiful design, but is it practical? I tend to think it could be, if positioned correctly. I think that American ideas about what makes a home and what is acceptable as living space are underdeveloped and lacking true foundation. We have vast expanses of land and resources so we can do anything we want--even if it is excessive, inefficient and alienating. When dealing with spatial, resource, or financial limitations, the human mind is capable of coming up with much better methods. 

I've been thinking about this a lot, as I received two wonderful books on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3823845276/ref=wl_it_dp/105-1201587-7343640?ie=UTF8&coliid=I37MW39FJ6EP98&colid=3MRCPZ71AFE1F">design</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0789310651/ref=wl_it_dp/105-1201587-7343640?ie=UTF8&coliid=I50XX6IEDJTKR&colid=3MRCPZ71AFE1F">spatial architecture</a> over the holidays. I've been poring over them and even redesigned our living space to be more deliberate and indicative of our lifestyle. Maybe I'll at pics of the house at a later date.

<blockquote>"Keep the 4,900 yuan if you really need it, but please return the other things to me. You are still young. To err is human. Correcting your mistakes is more important than anything," Pan wrote.

She gave up hope of seeing her possessions again after sending 21 text messages without a reply.

But on her way out on Sunday morning, she stumbled over a package that had been left in her courtyard only to discover it was her stolen bag. Nothing had been taken.</blockquote>

I can't help but wonder if this is more than just an "oddly enough" piece. Lately I've been berating the masses (nagging my friends) over the irresponsible nature of American suburban living. We tire of the cramped spaces, lack of privacy, noise, crime, pollution; so we move out to the suburban areas, build a big house, a car and enjoy the quiet, peaceful life.

Problem is, we become isolated. The only people we interact with are the ones we let into our lives; as a result we have very little protocol for dealing with people we don't know and do not meet. Additionally, we forget that no one likes to live in unpleasant environments--which almost guarantees that the negative aspects of urban living will be transmitted into these suburban havens. This is what happens when you change the location instead of fixing the problem.

So. Now you are in the suburbs with noisy neighbors, kids who knock over your mailbox or mill around on the streets near your house. You are a prisoner in your castle because you have no interaction with anyone outside of your circle; the only time you even see these people is as you walk to your car. You moved to a gated community. The cycle continues.

What about facing issues? It's harder to steal/vandalize/misuse something that belongs to someone you know. It's also hard to be afraid of someone who you have consistent personal interaction with, no matter what walk of life they are from. What if we stopped running from problems and started walking towards them? Everyone would be improved in the long run. Like the lady in this article, what if we stopped trying to get people thrown in prison and actually, tangibly, tried freeing them from debilitating situations? I'm not talking tossing money at the problem; I'm talking visibility. Personal association.

Hey, I'm just as guilty. But we can work on it together, can't we?

<blockquote>To me, the Philippines seems like the Haiti of Asia. All the foreign aid in the world won窶冲 solve its problems and the country seems to find itself in everlasting debt. The people haven窶冲 seemed to find the necessary empowerment needed to provoke a positive difference in their lives and the government enjoys its access to power at the expense of its citizens.

Can the country ever pull itself together and meet the potential I窶冦 sure it has? My personal opinion would be to revamp the government and get Glorio Arroyo out of office and someone else in her position through a fair, democratic election (which I don窶冲 believe Arroyo窶冱 re-election was).

I admit, I don窶冲 know a lot about the Philippines at all, mainly because my interest in the country is quite low. I know very, very little, in fact. But from what I can gather of it, nothing seems to change there and perhaps for that reason, it has a very dim light on my Asia radar. Those more informed, however are invited to educate me.</blockquote>

Being married to a Pinay-American, I think I was a little put off by this entry. I'm usually in agreement with Jodi (or at least willing to accept her POV) but I feel like this time it's completely subjective, un-researched and speculative--which is so unlike her usual writing. I don't however, feel I have the level of information to set the record straight. Hmm...new ethnographical study, anyone?

<blockquote>goo Rankings published another one of their silly yet slightly unsettling polls recently, when they looked at what things are impossible to do now that they are an adult. The original Japanese version is phrased to have a suggestion of regret, I feel. The survey was conducted between the 18th and 20th of December last year.</blockquote>

This is one of those quirky blogs where you can't imagine why someone would make it....but it's just so darn interesting. My specific interest in this piece is that, while it is relatively low, Writing Kanji was listed in this top 20 list. Enter Leftsider, enrolled in Japanese II this semester--which focuses on Kanji learning. Hmm.

<blockquote>Kabu カブ means "stock" and tore トレ is short for "trade." I bought this game for the DS out of curiousity. It's an interactive tutorial about how to do online stock trading put out by Konami. When I bought the game they gave me this net trading beginner's guide by Zai magazine and a form to sign up for an account at Monex Securities. In Japan, a great part of the DS lite's success is the huge number of non-gaming adults buying them to play educational games.</blockquote>

Gaming is often vilified, and <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/08/cabelname_the_state_of_america.htm">sometimes for good reason</a>. Yet <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/12/tv_vs_video_games.htm">I've recently postulated</a> that perhaps there is more to gaming than just pushing buttons.

Nintendo seems to be most keen to this. One of the reasons that I've really been excited about Nintendo recently is that it seems that they have started to <a href="http://www.cabel.name/2006/01/on-brain-training.html">redefine what it means to "game."</a> (previously <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/01/cabelname_on_brain_training_if.htm">noted</a>)

All of a sudden people are excited about games again. With the Wii's new controller <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U78ylX3hlvI&NR">it's hard to find gamers seated</a>, which kills the primary point of contention about video games--lethargy. A video game now can teach you, train you, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDzbDGtEC58">get you moving</a>.

While I'm not an avid gamer, I'm really intrigued by this new direction and am eager to explor the potential for social and intellectual stimulus in an area that desperately needs it.

I think Joi has a great answer here. It exudes hope, reinforces his optimistic nature and, most importantly to me, tells where he sees things going. Let's be honest; the only reason I'm a fanboy of Mr. Ito is because I think he has a good view of what tomorrow can be. So a post like this is pure gold to me.

The post also links to others' answers. See also <a href="http://www.kottke.org/07/01/what-are-you-optimistic-about">Kottke's</a> would be answer; compare and contrast on your own.

How about you? what are you optimistic about?

<blockquote>Seo Woo-seok, a professor at the University of Seoul's College of Urban Science, said Koreans’ confidence in their ability to overcome social obstacles has weakened and the nation’s growth engines such as aspirations to greater democracy have faded over the last 20 years.</blockquote>

The article says that the idea of a unified Korea is steadily becoming a pipe dream to South Koreans, but they assert that the reasoning is because the prospect of economic growth has become more appealing. 

I find this interesting after reading <a href="http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200701/200701020021.html">this tidbit</a> from the same paper, on the same day. Now that Korea is slated to be next to last in economic growth in 2007, do you think that would rejuvenate the reunification spirit again? Just thinking.

<blockquote>You may think it couldn't possibly be that a language could have words with such complex meaning, but let me just add this. I once browsed for a while in the wonderful Comparative Eskimo Dictionary and came to the conclusion that it looked as if you should be able to make up a single word that would mean "They were wandering about gathering up lots of stuff that smelled like dead fish." I sent an email to Jerry Sadock, who is a serious Eskimologist, asking whether this was true. Back came an email. It contained one (West Greenlandic Inuit) word.</blockquote>

That is absolutely fascinating. I must admit that I'm guilty of using the snow words myth, though I thought it to be true. It was an interesting anecdote that helped bring non-inclined minds to a somewhat esoteric concept. I guess I'll need to find a new object lesson.

Here's why the iPhone isn't something you'd fret over.

<strong>5. It would throw off your well-balanced life statement.</strong> Just holding that wonderfully slender piece of machinery in your grubby little paws says, "I'm a person who knows quality, loves cutting edge technology, and is living the life of tomorrow." But your sweatshirt says "i'm bummy, not athletic," your apartment says, "Ikea and Target ARE my design sense," your bank book is <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/archives/2006/10/time-spent-on-blogs-vs-personal-finance.html">screaming from neglect</a> and your car is just spewing last-century rhetoric. Then again, the iPhone could be a new start. Unfortunately, so could a new shower curtain. 
<strong>
4. The world is your entertainment center.</strong> Don't you just hate those loudmouths who won't quit on their phones? And all the people who wear these bluetooth devices 24-7 like they're in a hologram training from the Starship Enterprise? What about the <a href="http://www.bolt.com/stephenInNYC/video/Subway_Dancing_Man/4131">guy with his headphones so loud</a> that the whole bus/train/carpool/group crossing at the corner can sing along? Well, if you can't beat them, you can join them with 8gigs of music, movies, pictures and more. Just forget about the pulse of the city, the birds, the sound of schoolkids playing. <a href="http://www.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/paul/lyrics/louisa~1/whataw~1.html">The real world</a> is sooooo not gonna be on your iTunes playlist, is it?

<strong>3. All those sensors make it way too sensitive.</strong> If you lived in a jeans-and-mock-turtleneck world like Mr. Jobs you could work with this phone. You're on your way, but you're not there yet. Your phone is lucky if it gets a clip or holster on the belt. Matter of fact, when was the last time you owned a phone that you never dropped? Just a minute ago we were talking lawsuits about how easily the Nano's were scratching. Does that proximity sensor activate shields when it senses it's about to slip out of your pocket and slide under your driver's seat? What about on the way to the concrete as you stumble and try to save the <a href="http://www.michaelhanscom.com/eclecticism/2007/01/09/4000-lattesto-go/">4,000 orders of Starbucks</a> that you were holding in the other hand?

<strong>2. Your good karma bill is past due. </strong>Take an iPod and a smartphone's cost and you're already around the iPhone's price range. But even if you wear a <a href="http://www.livestrong.org/">LIVESTRONG band</a>, your favorite color is <a href="http://www.joinred.com/">(RED)</a>,  and you think we should get out of Baghdad, Iraq and into <a href="http://www.savedarfur.org/content">Darfur</a>, Sudan, you're still gonna be a materialistic prick once you pick one of these boys up. Hundreds of kids could be <a href="http://www.adra.org/site/PageServer?pagename=cat07_Ecommerce_home&s_src=homebutton">immunized</a>, a loan could be made to a third-world <a href="http://kiva.org/">entrepreneur</a>, or if you're really in a good mood, you could <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_pop_und_1_a_day-economy-population-under-1-day">alleviate the burden of a couple people for at least a year</a>. What? You still want it? Yeah, I guess it does match well with your new Hummer in the fourth garage of your slave-maintained plantation with the "Kill the Poor" flag waving in the front yard. Hmm. 

<strong>1. You wouldn't even use it.</strong> You've used the crappy camera on your current phone, like, twice. You do use your iPod pretty regularly, but just for music and maybe a game--never anything more like for <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/home_learning/provoc.html">language training</a> or <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/ipod/manage-your-todo-lists-on-your-ipod-229246.php">schedule-keeping</a>. You have a contact list on your home computer but you don't maintain it with any consistency. The last time you were on a conference call you didn't initiate it. You never knew that even your current crappy phone can send text, picture messages and email while on call. And that my friend, is the number one reason--and reason enough--that the <a href="http://tags.gizmodo.com/gadgets/iphone">iPhone</a> is not for you.

<blockquote>The cold, hard truth about the Bush administration’s strategy of “surging” additional U.S. forces into Iraq is that it could work. Insurgencies are rarely as strong or successful as the public has come to believe. Iraq’s various insurgent groups have succeeded in creating a lot of chaos. But they’re likely not strong enough to succeed in the long term. Sending more American troops into Iraq with the aim of pacifying Baghdad could provide a foundation for their ultimate defeat, but only if the United States does not repeat its previous mistakes.</blockquote>

There was an Economist piece recently that said largely the same thing. I tend to agree. I wonder if most people are really thinking about Iraq when they make their assumptions on the war. I'm not really sure what they're thinking about.

<blockquote>For more than a decade, Orlando Boquete lived as a fugitive, his very identity a shackle he slipped out of, again and again. He hid bits of sandpaper in his wallet so that in a pinch, he could abrade his fingerprints. Every bit as revealing as the ridges of his fingers, the ordinary, reflexive responses to his own name — a grunt, a sideways glance, a shifting foot — also vanished under the grind of fugitive life. It was as if someone had suddenly clapped hands in front of his eyes and he did not blink. Standing still, not saying yes or hello or uh-huh became a martial art.</blockquote>

If you know anything about the way Leftsider does holidays, you will invariably expect to see a gaming console of some sort being heavily used during the festivities. It started in childhood, when my sister and I would eagerly anticipate visiting my cousins and their Nintendo. Our parents wouldn't allow us to own one, so we hoarded all the time we could with the precious machine while we were there. Conversely, our cousins would bring their games with them when they visited us....since there is nothing to do in the country for someone who grew up in the Bronx.

Now that we're all considerably older, I play video games only on occasion. For a while there Joey and I got pretty serious into some PS2 titles, but after his death my playstation  and OUR 25-30 games mysteriously vanished from the inventory. Returning back to the US, I had lost a lot of my gaming spirit.

Still, playing with my cousins is something that was a tradition. And, as it seems that I've given up Christmas to the in-laws to hold on to the sanctity of my beloved Thanksgiving, I decided to see if I could put a little bit of home in the mix. This time, I brought an Xbox along for the trip, with a few games.

Nobody in the house would touch the thing. Not a soul. Except for one visiting friend's boyfriend--who try very valiantly not to run down the stairs when I mentioned an xbox--I spent my entire gaming time in isolation.

Why? It seemed there was a stigma attached to playing video games. This surprised me as one guy was apparently a pretty active computer gamer and all of the guys had no problem sitting and channel surfing for hours on end. For me, I have a negative inclination to watching television.

I was born in front of a television. Growing up in rural America, it was my friend, my advisor, my babysitter, and, of course, my entertainment. I longed to leave the country to find more things to do. And once I did leave for more urban areas, my attachment to the television has consistently diminished. Today, I have not seen more than one episode of any show on television this season. I don't even know the names of half the shows. Sitting in my den watching TV makes me feel like a lower species; a slack-jawed, dull-eyed, cretin. 

Which I am, but only in regards to the internet. Remember that.

Imagine the awkwardness of the olive branch offers: They decline when I offer them a controller, I have no idea when they ask me what I want to watch on television. There was no middle ground; I realized that the two activities were so close--the same screen--but oh so far.

I still contend that when I watch TV I feel like I'm <em>doing nothing</em>. I sit; the screen shoves crap down my senses and my only option is to change the channel. I don't create, filter, or edit what any particular channel gives me. I can change the channel but I cannot change the content. I sit; not using any muscles and very little intellect. The show always explains an ending and gives my clues when to laugh or feel some other emotion. While I sit and stare at a screen online, I do choose exactly what I see; video games have an ultimate ending but I must think and interact to get there.

Perhaps my perception of gaming has changed. Indeed, my ideas about television have. With new, more family-friendly consoles like the Wii, will gaming gain a greater foothold on the traditional picture of the family gathered around the television (remember when that was the radio? or even just the fireplace?)? Which do you think is more sociable?

It is the phenomenon whereby video clips, often produced by individuals acting on their own, are rapidly disseminated throughout the world thanks to video-sharing Web sites such as YouTube, Google Video, and others. Every month, YouTube receives 20 million visitors, who watch 100 million video clips a day. There are 65,000 new videos posted every day. Most of the videos are frivolous, produced by and for teenagers. But some are serious. YouTube includes videos posted by terrorists, human rights groups, and U.S. soldiers in Iraq. Some are clips of incidents that have political consequences or document important trends, such as global warming, illegal immigration, and corruption. Some videos reveal truths. Others spread disinformation, propaganda, and outright lies. All are part of the YouTube effect.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A few weeks ago, a couple of friends and I were talking about where we want to travel this year, and one of them said something that surprised me. "You probably wouldn't approve, but I want to go to the Caribbean this year."

Huh? Why wouldn't I approve?

I thought about this in a pensive stare for many moments, taking the form of Rodin's Thinking Man and wishing that I had a pipe and perhaps a tweed jacket. Then I figured it out. Apparently, I'm the personal-finance guy to some people. And, I realized with a sinking feeling, to many people, "the personal-finance guy" means "the guy who tells me I can't do stuff because it costs too much money."

Nothing could be further from the truth. Now, I will call your ass out when you're being stupid about money. But I'm not the finger-wagging parent who tells you not to spend money on lattes. Instead of taking a simplistic "don't spend money on expensive things!!!" view, I believe there's a nuanced approach to spending. Today, I'm going to tell you about 3 friends who are spending lots and lots of money on things you might consider frivolous--like shoes and going out--but I'm going to tell you exactly why I think they're perfectly justified.</blockquote>

Another excellent post. Most people probably won't read through, and that's exactly why they'll be stuck with incorrectly pre-conceived notions about how and why they spend their money.

So Americans want to take action, they say: I know how to fix your life. I'll kill you." Europeans say: "I know how to fix my life. I'll kill myself." When you take both, you find out that rate of violent death is the same in Europe and America."

Now that's a panel worth listening to. I think Negroponte's response is intriguing, but I also think it avoided the bigger issue in a way: is doing what we think is right equivalent to doing "good"? Does "good" always transcend cultural philosophies? If not, do we force our "good" upon others who may not see it as such?

BODY:
Recently I've been battling a bit of depression; perhaps "allowed self-pity" would be a more accurate term. I tend to avoid too much personal meandering here just for the sake of your sanity, but I've really been thinking a lot in this gloom and it does pertain to what I'm studying/talking about in this medium with regularity.

Humans, by nature, are social creatures. My fascinations with social networks is that it is the means by which we are social. But what happens when those networks sour?

Be it sudden realization or a recent bout of paranoia, I've recently felt my value in many of the networks that I'm a part of has been undervalued. People are always asking for my input, seeking my involvement, wanting me to help. Yet many times my advice is not utilized, my efforts meet indifference, and my assistance is not regarded. 

I'm not asking for public appreciation. I am not interested in popularity or in being known. In the last few weeks, I've struggled to rally the collaborators on a project that was set to launch in January; I've created a private, well-poised forum for thought which  has not generated the support that its concept  did; I've accomplished some significant occupational projects that far outstretch my job description; I've been elected by organizational peers to lead a new initiative and had not one attendee at the first meeting called; I've juggled my full-time work and full-time school to maintain some level of interaction with my social acquaintances. None of these things has even seemed to have been noticed by anyone but me.

I picture a pyramid-type diagram when I think of what is now an outdated model of how information and work was distributed and done. In today's method, I think the diagram is more akin to a spider's web--information being received from a number of locations and combined/developed in an exponentially greater number of ways/directions. If I look at my own situation with the self-pitying glasses I'm currently wearing, perhaps I embody the door to the pyramid or the spider in the web, respectively.

The door to the pyramid is the least-marveled element of the structure. While it often determines input/output of information/work into the system, it is generally not listed as a contributor to progress. Additionally, because of its dissimilarity with the methods of its peers--combined with its tendency to be placed in the place which is least necessary to structural support--the door to the pyramid can be easily forgotten altogether.

The spider is the reason why the web exists. It establishes the framework, makes the necessary connections, and bridges gaps and weakening ties. At the moment that connections have been made, the spider is of no importance to the web. the web functions on its own--ideally, for the benefit of the spider. Only fate and time can ultimately tell, however, if the web will work in the spider's favor or not. As one who grew up in a rural environment, I've personally considered the spiderwebs of many a dead/absent spider. 

I like making silly analogies. The problem, however--what keeps me in this negative funk--is how to improve my situation. In both examples, choice is not given to roles played; is this true of our social networks? Do we choose how we want to interact or are our roles given?

If you find you have time, I'd be interested in hearing what your idea of a social network's structure is, how you see your role in it, and what can be don to alter the role once it no longer is effective. Is extrication the only answer?

I like your analogy of social networks as spider webs.  As you say, the spider's work is done once the web is created.  In a perfect world he would sit back and reap the fruit (fly) of his labor.  Until the big, dumb humans come along.  At some point, they realized they weren't capable of creating anything as intricate and beautiful as the spider web, nor are they smart enough to appreciate it's beauty.  Rather than try to gain perspective by studying the work of the spider, they destroy the spider's web.  The destruction is motivated by fear: fear that the spider's web is better than anything they could produce and fear of the spider itself. This fear is prompted by feelings of inadequacy and this is something you nor I can control.  We must make a choice: build another web, alone and with out recognition for our marvelous creation; find a new location for our web, free from the idiot humans who crash blindly through the forest; or cease to exist.

How's that for an analogy?

Not bad man....not bad... :)
I think that it would be sad if our social networks were that similar to the spider's web. We need them to survive, but we can't expect much from them? Interesting. Also, I like the big dumb human parallel, but often times webs are broken by other objects with less of an evil connotation. Maybe this is like a genetic drift?

<a title="Foreign Policy: What Iraq Tells Us About Ourselves" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3734">Foreign Policy: What Iraq Tells Us About Ourselves</a>

<blockquote>To be blunt, our foreign policy tends to be predicated on the notion that everyone wants to be an American. In the months leading up to the start of the Iraq War, it was common to hear seemingly educated people say that the Arabs, particularly Iraqis, had no way of life worth saving and would be better off if all “that old stuff”—their traditions, social institutions, and values—were done away with, and soon. The U.S. Armed Forces and U.S. Agency for International Development would be the sharp swords of modernization in the Middle East.

How did Americans come to believe that the entire world is embarked on the same voyage, and that we are the navigators showing the way to a bright future? Our own culture is a rich blend, brewed from such elements as enlightenment, optimism, Puritan utopianism, a Calvinist tendency to not forgive sinners, and the settler’s lack of respect for the weak and “native” peoples of the world. In the United States, such threads have pushed us to believe that we are all in a melting pot of common ideology. This belief system has been fed to us in the public schools, through Hollywood, and now in the endless prattle of 24-hour news networks. It has become secular religion, a religion so strong that any violation of its tenets brings instant and savage condemnation. So called “neoconservatism” isn’t some kind of alien ideology; it’s merely a self-aware manifestation of the widespread American belief that people are all the same. The repeated assertion by U.S. President George W. Bush that history is dominated by the existence of “universal values” is proof in the pudding.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There is, of course, nothing new about the connection between football and violence, a relationship going well back before the sport was professionalised in the late 19th century. It so happens that I’m currently reading a fascinating book by sociologists Norbert Elias and Eric Dunning, Quest for Excitement: Sport and Leisure in the Civilizing Process (London: Basil Blackwell, 1986).

I haven’t gotten to the articles (mainly by Dunning, who has specialised on the sociology of sport) which give detailed attention to the association between violence and football, but I’ve run across some interesting things in Elias’s introduction. As in his other work, he emphasises the growing necessity, over centuries of development, for the self-control of emotions and urges in what he refers to as ‘civilising processes’. The growing ‘pacification’ of society is on the one hand, positive; it can, however, also be frustrating, as opportunities for relatively free emotional expression are lessened. In Quest for Excitement, sport is seen as an important arena for the ‘controlled de-controlling of emotions’ and its ‘mimetic’ conflicts stand in for those which in earlier ages were – relatively speaking – far more a part of real life. However, it’s not that simple and benign.</blockquote>

<a title="Guernica / Unintelligent Design" href="http://www.guernicamag.com/interviews/265/unintelligent_design_1/">Guernica / Unintelligent Design</a>

<blockquote>I wrote about two types of beauty, one that is singular, planned, and imposed, the other that is manifold, unplanned, and accumulated slowly over time through historical layering. It’s this second type that is being destroyed in Chinese cities through the narrowing of history in order to build the present. Now, since China is in transition, there are still places where you can see a layering of history, but as these get destroyed, and others “preserved”—that is, rebuilt so that they become a very specific idea from the present of what the past should be—they become rarer and rarer.

Hu Jintao is now instructing the country to build a “harmonious society,” an umbrella concept that is related to this singular, planned idea of beauty, and that encompasses all the trends China has been pushing for: channeling society into the dominant idea of how it should be organized, unifying culture at the expense of contradiction and difference, and directing opinion at the expense of dissent. I experienced one manifestation of this harmonious society in Inner Mongolia, where I ate at a Mongolian restaurant whose attendants, all Chinese, in Mongolian dress, were singing “I am a Mongolian,” in Chinese. And this push for harmony translates into the shape of China’s cities. Cities in China are becoming increasingly uniform, increasingly designed around sustaining the engine of the market by creating the framework for a consumer-oriented society.

I don’t, however, think the possibility for beauty can be foreclosed, because beauty can take so many forms. I’ve only talked about two forms. There is beauty that arises from the unexpected, when our familiar perspectives are thrown off balance. There is also the beauty that paradoxically comes out of the tragic, that emerges because we are reminded of what is no longer there, that becomes powerful because of what is absent.</blockquote>

This is where I think when I think about my love/hate relationship with planned communities. I love the natural transmogrification of old cities and am loathe to be in a place that tries to organize everything. Yet at the same time I am of the perception that our luxurious increase of suburban sprawl is a bane to society and should be replaced by building--deliberately--"upward" instead of outward. Not that every world should be filled with skyscrapers, but instead that every space should be deliberately thought out and maximized.
Can these two beauties co-exist? be sure to look at the photos in this interview and then ask that question again.

BODY:
 After a sobering approximation of my fitness at a recent health fair, I've been really conscious about my weight, diet, and physical activity. I'm managed to dredge myself from the mattressed grave and get into the gym in the mornings again, and I've given myself a target deadline--my trip to Costa Rica at the end of March.

One problem still remains. I have no fuel to fire my workout. When I was younger, I would pour out my angst, my frustrations, my will to achieve into my workout and push myself to the next level. Nowadays, I realize that my life really must be pretty good, as all of those things are in short supply. 

The ultimate proof of this was evidenced today. I threw some weight on the bar for bench pressing. Roughly a hundred pounds, not a problem. For the next set, I wanted to push myself, so I added 50 pounds. Lifted the bar with ease, slowly descended....and at that point realized that I wasn't really interested in pushing that much weight back up.

As a fellow member came over and helped me lift the weight off my chest, I had a flashback of, say, ten years ago. A time when I weighed about 30 pounds less and regularly lifted about 30 pounds more. I used to tell my friends, who would nod in agreement, "It's just a matter of survival...every person should at least be able to bench his/her own weight." A deflated ego is a terrible thing to experience. 

The disturbing element for me is that I don't think that I was incapable of pushing that bar back up. I believe the energy required to do that is still inside me. So why can't I tap into it, even at a time of general emergency like that? It makes me wonder if I'd be able to do something if the moment demanded it. Moreover, the link between mind and body....would my brain do the same if placed under duress?

Yesterday I skipped work to catch up on some languishing studies, mostly Japanese. I woke up, called in, went back to bed, got up again, locked myself in an empty room (Fru was also working from home so I didn't want to be distracted) and studied in earnest for 5-6 hours. 

To be honest, it felt really good. Doing nothing but learning is not as boring as one might assume. And when I crawled out of that room I felt accomplished, a little closer to current as far as school goes.

Most notably, I felt a clarity that my mind had been without for a while. An empty head is really a great thing (thinking about David Allen's concept). And it showed; before the day was done I had two really significant epiphanies and a couple fascinating conversations during my class that evening. 

Driving home I wondered if it was coincidence that the one day I don't deal with office issues is the day that all my ideas bubble over to the surface. Could it be that my work is cooling my jets? Or, to its defense, am I not approaching work in a way that it can fuel my thinking?

Lots of things to think about. Unfortunately I'll have to schedule that think time in as the office is back with a vengance. :)

So often I daisy-chain my way to a task completely arbitrary to my intent. GTD should be a lifesaver for me.

<a title="The Next American City" href="http://americancity.org/article.php?id_article=212">The Next American City</a>

<blockquote>At first, the site attracted only a handful of gardeners. But after a formal dedication ceremony, a number of farmers, including Latino immigrants who had initially hesitant, began to establish plots. From the mid-1990s until 2006, the South Central Farm, as gardeners came to call it, evolved into a striking landscape. Eventually as many as 350 Latino gardeners (or campesinos) participated in growing such crops as corn, beans, and nopales cactus, and herbs like jimsonweed and cilantro. They grew guava and other fruits. “The plants sown only intensified the otherworldliness of the place,” reporter Emily Green said of the garden in a 2004 Los Angeles Times magazine story. Latino New Urbanist James Rojas characterized the farm as a mini “pueblo” for its community activities. Land that was otherwise surrounded by warehouses, truck traffic, and the Alameda rail lines, was completely transformed.

As an urban place, the farm also turned into a safe haven - drug-free, gang-free, and graffiti-free. Reconstructing a kind of urban plaza and green space familiar to Latino immigrants, the garden facilitated social networks and was a gathering spot for families. On any given day, it attracted as many people as could be found in some city parks. The campesinos also established traditions like the Garden Day L.A. celebration, where food and plant vendors, musicians, and folklorica dancers gathered for a day-long fair. </blockquote>

Now, I take out a yellow pad every morning and write my thoughts for the day, which allows me to be much more strategic and proactive than reactive."</blockquote>

I really like this concept. I'm not sure I can really implement it since I attend classes in the evenings, but the premise seems ideal.

While not all computers in this price range will have Windows Vista installed on them, some are ready to update when you are. And if you aren’t in a hurry to upgrade, you can find some great deals on Windows XP laptops. </blockquote>

<blockquote>They spoke of a black America adrift. Black males are more common in prisons than on college campuses, they said. Black children, meanwhile, are increasingly born into single-parent homes.

"A lot of us have lost the dignity that our community has shown from Jamestown to now," Sharpton said.

Others pointed to a lack of personal responsibility among blacks who, they said, are waiting for leaders to make changes.

"I didn't have to wait for people to tell me it was my time to run for governor -- it was my time," Wilder said, encouraging other blacks to take similar personal initiative. "We can't stop here."</blockquote>

Can't remember the last time I said I agreed with Al Sharpton. But yeah.

This article is mildly interesting, especially if you are interested in property right now. The real reason I give it some note here is because of this absolute atrocity of an analogy here: 
<blockquote>
Like worms that surface after a torrential rain, revelations that emerge when an asset bubble bursts are often unattractive, involving dubious industry practices and even fraud. In the coming weeks, some mortgage market participants predict, investors will learn not only how lax real estate lending standards became, but also how hard to value these opaque securities are and how easy their values are to prop up</blockquote>

I don't know how that passed the editors. It should be added to my list of other <a href="http://writingenglish.wordpress.com/2006/09/12/the-25-funniest-analogies-collected-by-high-school-english-teachers/">analogy favorites</a>.

It is indeed a neat little video, but I thought mildy contrived. I definitely echoed the video's commenters in that it immediately put me in mind of the Royksopp video I had seen years before. While the Longcut video does tell a more specific story, the Royksopp one stays truer to the term infographics (and I personally think is more catchy). 

Who says information graphics can't be fun?

<blockquote>
It seems to me that if you're a designer, a proper designer not someone who learnt Photoshop in between phone calls, then design runs through your veins like Pantone 7418. But more than that, it's there in every aspect of life. You can't stop looking at things through your designer eyes. Everything you do is clouded by this thing that lives inside you.

Now, this is no bad thing. But I'm becoming fascinated by how this thing takes hold of us all and I'd like to share it with you lovely people.</blockquote>

Great post. I passed this along to my graphic design friends and the all were singing its praises. I think it is vitally important to be consumed by at least one passion; have one thing that makes you swoon in bliss or nearly die from its loss or misappropriation. Most people look for that in love, but brilliant people find it in their work.

<blockquote>Over the past 15 years, it has been opportunistic newcomers — Houston, Charlotte, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Dallas, Riverside — that have created the most new jobs and gained the most net domestic migration. In contrast there has been virtually negligible long-term net growth in jobs or positive domestic migration to places like New York, Los Angeles, Boston or the San Francisco Bay Area.</blockquote>

Sounds like something I've been thinking. Obviously, it's supported more credibly than <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/08/finally_got_away_for_a.htm">my meanderings</a>. Still, I wish there was a way to recognize the potential of an upstart city so that you could cash in early and take advantage. Of course, if there was, I'm sure I wouldn't be the only one cashing in; perhaps that's why I can't get a hold of that algorithm. :)

We would joke casually about the dangers of having kids in Korea. If your kid turned out horribly ugly or completely different from you, you can blame it on you wife's plastic surgery. Chances are, you have no idea what she really looks like. 

I've heard horror stories about women being afraid to show their new husbands their faces without makeup, so this statistic (especially if it includes the eyelid modification) doesn't surprise me at all.

If someone left a backpack full of explosives in a crowded movie theater, or detonated a truck bomb in the middle of a tunnel, no one would demand to know why the police hadn't noticed it beforehand. But if a weird device with blinking lights and wires turned out to be a bomb -- what every movie bomb looks like -- there would be inquiries and demands for resignations. It took the police two weeks to notice the Mooninite blinkies, but once they did, they overreacted because their jobs were at stake.

<blockquote>
And I think this is why hipsterdom is often the pupal stage for artists or people who are interested in art. Hipster clothing and conversations are very standardized, but that's why they are useful: it enables young artists to find each other, and to talk about art in a way that emphasizes community rather than the deeply personal effect it has on most people. This is why hipsters are often obsessed with lists and categories rather than feelings. It's hard to describe why anyone would like Marcel Dzama and burlesque and knitting and neon purple tights and The Decemberists and Russian prison tattooes and R. Kelly, but if two participants in a conversation do like these lists of things, then they can recognize they have similar feelings about the world, however poorly they've expressed that viewpoint directly. Hipsterdom is a shorthand for a varied and shifting view of North American culture.</blockquote>

It's called cassado, and it consists of rice and beans unmixed, plantain, and either beef (pictured) or fish. We ate so much of this type of meal you would not believe. I, however, never got tired of it.

My cousin Ramiro noted that the original purpose was to keep out thieves, but a large part of it has become an issue of decoration and outpacing the neighbors. <br />

This is at his house.

	Gray day, rainy, spent mainly in a bus and making/translating chitchat with our group members (largely because that was the extent of my spanish). Tired, largely over it all, I squeezed into the last spot on an overcrowded water taxi so that Fru wouldn't arrive at Bocas alone. I left Tav with his drinking buddy Ramiro at the dock for the next boat.<br />
<br />
I'm staring out at the water. It's overcast but the water is still so clear. Then I spot it: A dolphin jumping out of the water about 20 meters away from our boat.<br />
<br />
This is about the time that I realized that I live a life that could arguably show up on one of those <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR910-cIauE">old American Express commercials</a>. Ten years ago I would have never imagined that I'd purposely spend my birthday traveling in Central America with relatively affluent tourmates, a beautiful wife and so on. I've lived abroad, I can effectively mangle four languages, been on television, been published. Despite how I like to look at it, or how I stack up against others in the United States, I am privileged. And I'm ok with that.^^ <br />
<br />
Here's a tidbit for your next beer/wine/cocktail party (my professor says this at least three times a class): The average monthly income of a <em>Costarricense</em> is US$300. Yeah. I'm privileged.

It's good to see that there are people who refuse to give up on a fusion of digital and analog i/o. Especially since <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/10/handwriting_the_lost_art.htm">so much can be lost </a>when we abandon one practice for another, I see this as a benefit for all--and at a price that isn't unreasonable.

Haven't linked to any design recently, and this wrap-up had so many interesting items that I couldn't pick which one to show. That's a good week! :)

Forgive me for giving you links that are nearly a month old, but that's just about how far back I am in my reader. I have all intention to make significant progress in this matter over the weekend, when I catch up on the other things that are behind (largely because of my recent energyless depression), like schoolwork and side projects. 

No sleep till Brooklyn for me!

<blockquote>Children who were praised for their effort were more likely to choose a harder test when given a choice, were less likely to become disheartened when given a test they were guaranteed to fail, and when finally given the original tests again, their marks improved.

In contrast, the children praised for their intelligence tended to choose an easier test if asked, were distressed by failure, and actually had worse marks after re-taking the original tests.</blockquote>

Wow this is really interesting. I really wonder about this for personal reasons. I guess it would be difficult to determine whether this could be adjusted/reversed after childhood. Hmm.

BODY:
I've been dreaming more vividly lately. I always consider dreams to be a measurement of your brain's activity. 

When I was young, I would have unbelievably vivid dreams. I can still remember two of them; one was a recurring nightmare at a pumpkin farm, while the other one was a glorious apparition where I lived in a two-story glass house and eventually turned into an all-powerful, albeit non-flaming, phoenix. 

As I pushed further into school, and particularly in that stage where coolness must be <em>exuded</em>, I feel like my dreaming diminished. I often had good dreams, but nothing so exciting; more often than not, I retold my good dreams from before rather than dream up anything new. I think this says a lot about this period of my life.

But they're back now, and I'd like to think that their intensity is in no small part to the content that I am putting into my subconscious. The new feature, however, is how involved my dreams have become with my conscious thought.  in my last dream, not only did I speak Japanese (poorly, over a meal with a grocer in Japan) but I actually mentioned items on my agenda for today in conversation. Talk about reinforcement!

Yes my last dream session was a doozy. I also attended a lovely wedding. Time passed while at the reception, and I watched the couple--newly attired--in a beautifully arranged renewal of vows. One room had been set up and was restricted from guests, looking inside, I saw a replica of their wedding cake sitting on what looked like a table in a cafeteria. My sense told me that this hidden room was reserved for them to remember where they first met/fell in love, and I was struck with emotion as the wave of their memories rushed into my mind. I cried at the sweetness of their love, to the extent that I was nearly drawn from the dream by the realization that I was almost crying into my pillow in the real world. 

Yes, this is the same dream where I sat and talked shop with the Japanese grocer over a freshly prepared meal, listened to a band not unlike the roots play inside a passing school bus, and ran to join a rap battle along side an unknown friend and Notorious B.I.G. Yes it was a wild for hours of sleep.

Fru loves to sleep. It is her default action when her choices have all been used. For me, sleeping (and eating for that matter) is not so much an activity as it is a method to keep the activities going. Thankfully I've dreams to keep the sleeping times just as exciting.

February's blues put me so far behind; much of March was spent bemoaning the situation. But as this month draws to a close, I'm happy to say that I've really pushed myself to new limits and have largely accomplished a lot of what I'd left undone. 

As a result, I'll reap the benefits. Tomorrow morning I head to New York City, where I'll shoot some stand-ups for a show that I'll be hosting live <a href="http://hopetv.org/article.php?id=4">Thursday at 7pm</a>. The show is called "Let's Talk New York City," and is one of a series that places younger Adventists in an unedited, unscripted discussion with the president of the Adventist world church. 

It's a part of a larger plan to connect with the youth of the church, as a majority of the church body is now under the age of 35. There's also <a href="http://letstalk.adventist.org/">a website</a> that allows those who were not fortunate enough to sit in a session to voice their concerns, questions, and criticisms. I'd love to be a part of the discussion, but unfortunately my job is to facilitate.

Friday morning Fru and I are off to holiday in Costa Rica. No, no particular eco-tour in our itinerary; rather, we're going to visit my family and celebrate my birthday (3rd April) as well as my feisty great-grandmother's (7th). It so happens that the week is also "Semana Santa," holy week, so we'll enjoy the country-wide festivities and time off. 

I've got other travel lined up, and I'm pretty excited. End of June I'll be attending <a href="http://gien.adventist.org/forum2007/index.html">GIEN</a> at  Newbold College in Berkshire, with a possibility of presenting on social networks. You have no idea how happy that makes me; if the travel wasn't enough, being able to present something that fascinates me to others at a convention makes all the <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/publications">vicarious living</a> I've been imagining seem so much more real. I'm happy to start from here, wherever that may be, and work my way up. I only wish I was as adept as these <a href="http://www.guykawasaki.com/speaking/index.shtml">veterans</a> at juggling the costs and <a href="http://joiwiki.ito.com/joiwiki/index.cgi?joi_s_travel">keeping the flow of engagements coming</a>. 

Late July I've been asked to be a speaker for one of the events in a mission initiative in Bacolod, Philippines. I'm a little apprehensive about this one because I don't have a real feel on who my audience will be. I like to scope out the mindset before presenting, just because my whole passion is built upon communicating in a way that is native to the thought processes of the recipient. l guess I'll have to do some quick assessing once I'm on the ground there.

Finally, I'm seeing if I can manage a way to get Fru and I to the second <a href="http://www.wcycs.org/main/main.asp">World Conference on Youth and Community Service</a>, a quinquennial event that will be happening in Taiwan around Christmas. I miss Asia something fierce and would love to check in and check out Taiwan. I know this is a ridiculous amount of travel for the average earthling, and that those who I admire are practically otherworldly in this respect. But I feel that if I can push myself to accomplish the ordinary and mundane tasks, I should reward myself by pushing to accomplish the extraordinary and novel things I'd so much rather be doing.

	It's the way I feel right now. My mind is lost between a two-week whirlwind of taxis, boats and buses; airports, cities and countries. I've started the last two mornings stuck between my home and traveling routines. Mixing languages. Feeling confused.<br />
<br />
It's strange not feeling at home even when I am at home. It's a new experience that I've not felt in previous travels. I'm not sure why this trip was any different from any other. The time changes were not a significant factor this time out... perhaps I never mentally unpacked. Anyway, now I have a lot of stuff to sort through to get back on the level this week. Posting resumes, but lightly.<br />
<br />
I hope to show a few pictures as well... stay tuned.

<blockquote>By the Realtors’ way of thinking, it’s always a good time to buy. Homeownership, they argue, is a way to achieve the American dream, save on taxes and earn a solid investment return all at the same time.

That’s how it has worked out for much of the last 15 years. But in a stark reversal, it’s now clear that people who chose renting over buying in the last two years made the right move. In much of the country, including large parts of the Northeast, California, Florida and the Southwest, recent home buyers have faced higher monthly costs than renters and have lost money on their investment in the meantime. It’s almost as if they have thrown money away, an insult once reserved for renters.</blockquote>

Because I subscribe to nearly a hundred different site feeds, I am often overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information that I receive. Overlook the reader for a day even, and I'm stuck with 5-600 entries to read.

A few friends say, "Son, just skip that and go from today. That's ridiculous." Arguably, they are correct. But I just can't let go, and there's a real reason for it beyond some obsessive compulsive disorder I may or may not possess: There are gems hidden in that pile, and a few feeds consistently provide great stuff. 

Case in point: Jason Kottke. He's been around forever, really. I remember I stopped reading his page for a while, though I can't remember why. I know that I've always been envious of his endeavors (you know, constantly improving the site, having a huge following, leaving employia to work on his blog as a job, that kind of thing) so that may have been a factor. Regardless, I will NEVER "mark all as read" on his feed. It's like flushing money down the drain. 

Here's what I'm talking about; selected gems from the last couple weeks or so:

	Are you ready to hear about our vacation? Great! cause as soon as I get back from a late night on the town I'll probably pass out from exhaustion. After that, however, I'll do a photo presentation of the trip.

	In addition to the bars on everyone's house, it would seem that there's a bar at practically every intersection in a Costa Rican city. Pictured are two of Ramiro's friends. He is a mathematician, she is a professor in horticulture, I believe.<br />
<br />
As I do not drink, Ramiro spurned me in favor of Tav, who as aforementioned is down for anything. :)

	Next stop was the volcano at Poas. When I think volcano, I think black rock, red lava, and searing, painful heat. What I got was paved road, a crater, acool breeze and the smell of eggs(sulfur).<br />
<br />
The clouds to the left covered the crater about 5 minutes after I took this photo. They say Costa Rica's 130 active volcanoes are covered about 70% of the time, so I guess we were lucky.

	Stop three was to the Waterfall Gardens, where they have a bunch of cool stuff in addition to waterfalls. The butterfly garden was probably the highlight of the tour, although only edging out the hummingbird garden. There was also an orchid garden, which probably wouldn't have been so pathetic if I hadn't been to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/sets/1716333/">the world's largest orchid garden</a> a year or so earlier. The snake tour was lame, though. And there were some other things that didn't really register.<br />
<br />
The guy in the photo was in our tour group along with his mother and sister. They lived in Chiba prefecture, Japan. The mother studied Spanish in college and therefore was ok touring around. The kids were studying English, of course. So we had a good time with a few minutes of NihonSpanglish as the six of us communicated. :)

We ended off the tour with a river ride in Puerto Viejo de Sarapiqui. Spotting birds and sloths and monkeys in the trees; things of that sort. Finally it was time to drive back to San Jose and call it a night.

	The next day we went to another volcano, Iraizu, which also was very cold and lacking lava as seen here. I was floored not so much by the crater itself as I was by the drastic change in the flora of the area. I'm not sure if that is because of the sulfuric content, because of the elevation and temperature, or if it means that I should consider a career in studying plant life, but I was impressed.<br />
<br />
After the volcano we toured through Cartago, Costa Rica's first settlement. We saw the ruins of the first catholic church, the man-made lake and hydroelectric dam that powers much of Cartago and San Jose, and the Basilica. I'm sure we did something else but I forgot.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, we got stuck on the side of the road on the way to the volcano due to our van overheating, and we almost got stranded due to corroded cables unhooking form the van's battery and leaving the van dead. Other than that though, it was a wonderful time.<br />
<br />
The next morning we left for Limon.

	You may be saying to yourself, "Man, I thought this was going to be a peaceful and relaxing trip... looks like they never stop!" You would be thinking the exact same thing I was thinking.<br />
<br />
My general routine for my Costa Rica trips is as such: Fly in, Spend two days at my auntie's house bumming food and watching american movies with spanish subtitles to refresh my language, riding to Limon and vegging out at the beaches, go back one day before my flight leaves to see my great-grandma, fly home. Lots of meals with family and hanging out all through there.<br />
<br />
This time though I had to keep people <em> entertained</em>. I was a host and so I was rapidly getting cranky because I hadn't found my relaxation yet. When Ramiro asked if we would be interested in touring Bocas del Toro, Panama, with a group he was taking down, I was torn as it would further prevent me from enjoying my usual hideaways. But, it was another stamp on the passport and a ridiculously low price; we took the offer and were soon walking (yes, walking) across this bridge to Changuinola, Panama.

Just as an aside, I'd like to recognize <a title="Snap" href="http://www.snap.com/">Snap</a> and let them know how cool a team I think they are. 

If you aren't already aware, Snap.com provides a script that generates a small window preview of any outgoing links on your site. It's a novel little idea that gained popularity quickly. Just as fast, however, it gained a lot of (undeserved, IMHO) criticism from some of the web's finest, claiming that it was obtrusive, garish, and disrupted the flow of the web reading "experience."

The commendable thing about the team at Snap is that they didn't just listen to the needs of those people who loved and used them. They also listened to the nay-sayers and implemented features that allowed you to personally turn off Snap's preview boxes on a individual or total basis. Then they updated the script to give the administrator the ability to use the boxes as usual or to in an "upon-click" manner.  Listen to the flack, then shut them up. Excellent.

Now yesterday as I was putting up the first half of the vacation presentation, I noticed that the boxes were changing as I posted. Now, they support flickr photostreams and youtube videos more directly, along with a list of other sites that they make direct accommodation for. Constant improvement based on objective reception of feedback, good or bad, and logical progression always wins a big beat of pride in my heart. Keep up the good work Snap; success will be yours.

<blockquote>In 1791 and 1792, Andrew Ellicott and his surveying team placed 40 boundary stones around the perimeter of the District of Columbia, one at each mile of the original diamond shape. They laid the first stone, the south corner stone, at Jones Point on April 15, 1791, under the guidance of Benjamin Banneker. According to legend, "Banneker fixed the position of the first stone by lying on his back to find the exact starting point for the survey ... and plotting six stars as they crossed his spot at a particular time of night." </blockquote>

Totally interesting. Anyone interested in scoping out a stone or two?

So about the <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">GTD</a> thing.

I initially wasn't interested in Getting Things Done simply because I'm never interested in things that <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/01/top_5_reasons_why_the_iphone_i.htm">everyone raves about and tells me I should do</a>. I'm pretty sure I know what my faults are as far as organization is concerned: I procrastinate and I'm lazy. I'm also an idealist, which never helps. Reading a book did not seem to me to be the logical solution to that conundrum. 

I did, however, want to know enough to reject the idea intellectually, so I borrowed the book from a friend (who had not finished it; typical) and started reading. The first chapters were unbelievably interesting, so I decided I'd follow the trend and do this GTD thing.

Note: I always feel like I'm cursing when I write GTD. ha. (In japanese emoticons, I'm actually sorta <a href="http://whatjapanthinks.com/2006/08/14/japans-top-thirty-emoticons/">banging my head on the floor</a>!)

I also  was able to get David Allen's Getting Things Done Fast presentation in Audio format with the workbooks. So I figured I'd listen to it and be done with it even faster. Well, if there's one thing that this system will do, it will take off those rose-colored glasses and tell you <a href="http://twitter.com/Leftsider/statuses/9430051">the real deal</a>; I'm still nowhere near finished with the book or audiobook, and it shows.

Case in point: When I came to Leftsider today, I noted it was about time for a new photo. I thought that I might be able to put a link or two more, but after that, I'd like to put a picture before anything else significant--like this piece. I noted a typo and logged in to correct it, at which point a realized that there was <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/03/the_man_holding_me_down.htm">a comment that had not been attended to</a> (about GTD, coincidentally) . After addressing both issues, I got started on procuring the links for this post and decided to flesh out my ideas to ascertain which links I'd actually need. Upon writing, I realized (at this point, basically) that I was supposed to be putting an image before any prominent pieces. I went to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/friends/">Flickr</a>, to see what I could add. Unfortunately, there was an indication that someone had commented on my photos. I checked out what was new. A friend had left a half dozen messages--he had actually told me last week that he had, so I responded to them. On the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/390387263/">last one</a>, I wanted to reference a Korean phrase I recently learned (when someone used it in reference to me in my <a href="http://cyworld.nate.com/leftsider">Cyworld Hompage</a>), but I couldn't remember it for certain. So, off to Cyworld I go to reference the spelling of this word. Upon login, I note that a few people had left comments in my guestbook. I, naturally, respond to them quickly; I recall that I've not talked to them on their pages for quite sometime, so I'm just about off to do that before I remember that there are still quite a few pics I haven't put in my Cyworld photo album. So instead I attach my phone to the computer and download the pics that have been waiting for release. It is while I'm sitting watching the files download that I remember: CRAP! I was getting a photo for Leftsider! Let me go do that now....wait...d'oh! I've a flickr page open waiting for a korean phrase I also forgot about....and on and on the cycle goes.

Can you see why I need GTD? ^-^;

If my own situation wasn't reason enough, Adam Greenfield got me all wrapped up in the idea of the working GTD system (<a href="http://speedbird.wordpress.com/2007/03/07/clean-living-approaching-the-optimal-stack/">what he calls the "optimal stack"</a>)...which is where I could spend the rest of my life work if given the opportunity. Kangmi's comments (on Leftsider; above) were the sobering reality that, despite all my efforts, I really wasn't getting anything done at all. Thankfully, someone who has <a href="http://www.kangmi.org/index/weblog/comments/tools_for_concentration_part_ii/">fared a little better</a> is extending some well-needed support.

All said, I'm committed now to GTD. If I can't finish the book, I may as well give up on ever hoping to accomplishing the actual details. I conned Fru into listening to the first CD, and now she is interested as well. I think it'd be nice to get it done together. I'm also encouraging my office team to do the GTD thing as well; that way they'll at least understand what I'm trying to do.

Got any other suggestions for making this silly thing work? Let a brother know.

Wow, I wrote that almost two years ago.

I can definitely say that my GTD practice today is very little like it was back in the beginning.

And while I'm happy to serve as a real live resource, you should check out some of the excellent GTD resources out on the Internet. There's a lot of good information (not all of which you need, by the way).

There is a ton of info online, which I constantly run up against in my web searching. And don't think I didn't notice the frequency with which "Kangmi" and "GTD" showed up when googling for that post... you're pretty involved with the program!

<blockquote>
We now live in the middle of downtown Seattle in a condo (photo below) that’s less than half the size of our last House.  Our 3,200 square feet of Texas sprawl has been squeezed down to a cosmopolitan 1,200.  We’ve gotten rid of most of our furniture, clothes, and surplus artwork, and all of our meaningless “stuff.”  We’ve chucked the lawnmower and garden tools, and pared our dishes down to enough for only four.  And best of all -– most gloriously of all -– we’ve sold our three cars!

Our everyday lives have changed in every way imaginable.  We don't own a car, so we walk everywhere, including to and from work.  We use the bus or ferry if we want to go farther afield.  This has had a profound effect on how we interact with people.  We realize now that the cocoons of our cars kept us well insulated from the people around us.  Our genuine interactions were with family and coworkers, the only people who saw us stripped of the metal that clothed and protected us.  Our neighbors, we discovered, were virtually strangers.</blockquote>

Something I've been thinking about a lot and have been referring to as "the culture of space." When you are in close proximity to something you are forced to develop a familiarity with it, to understand it better. As a result of its closeness are encouraged to make it more useful and practical in your life. The muscles that you use to interact with things of this type are kept in good form. 

However, when you extricate yourself from something you find undesirable, you are not close to it. You do not learn to deal with it, nor to you find ways to make it practical. The muscles that you use to interact with things of this type eventually atrophy. Succinctly, <strong>avoidance reduces our tolerance levels</strong>.

So it comes as no surprise that when the modern American hangs out with friends, avoids strangers, goes to the local university, marries early, starts working for a large corporation first, buys a house in the suburbs (and later, moves to outside the suburbs), etc....that we naturally are reducing our ability to deal with diversity and conflict. Not only are we less tolerable of it, but we are also <em>incapable of handling and addressing it</em>.

I love this this writer's phrase "the cocoon of our cars." So very fitting. We drive to and from our destinations in solitude, returning to our big spacious homes where everyone and their preferences can be sectioned off by room. Case in point: formal and informal dining areas.

How can we correct poverty and fight crime; how can we build community and address injustices; who will save our cities and direct their growth if we run to the countrysides, spoiling the unspoilt areas. Have we forgotten that everyone dreams of something better? Are we naive enough to think that those who we have left behind would not rather be where we now are?

It is for this reason that I personally feel that choices like this couple made are socially responsible and holistically preferred. Let's become a people again.

I'd like to think that I'm greener than the average living person, but I'm basing that mainly on philosophical conclusion and less on actual recordable action. I recycle; I commute with my wife when going to work and I walk or bus home in the afternoons. I look for ways to use existing services rather than creating my own. But I still think I'd be pretty brown overall. :(

Crunch time.

While I squirm, here's another something I wrote suggesting a solution to cultural sensitivity. My professor suggested that it might be publishable with some adjustments; I wonder if I'm ruining the chance by placing it here? 

<blockquote>On a bus, headed from Changuinola, Panama, to San Jose, Costa Rica, it became painfully aware why I don't care for American company when traveling abroad. A handful of U.S. youths sat behind my wife and I, chattering away about their spring break journey. Crossing the border into my mother's country, they recalled their stay in the small border town of Sixaola by renaming it "Sex in the wrong hole-a." Particularly distasteful, one of the ladies in the party loudly proclaimed, "I'd rather have unprotected sex with a dirty, unknown man than stay in that place again." I noted to my wife that this person was basically saying she would sell her body rather than live any life other than one of privilege. No doubt this privilege was funding her education, paid for their vacation, and would bail them out if anyone within earshot and less tolerant was as weary of their complaining as I.</blockquote>

A week later, I read a passage from a Hans Christian Andersen tale that reminded me of that ordeal:

    "...what is far more advantageous abroad than all the preparations you can make at home, is said in a few words--give up all intercourse with your own country-people! Nowadays every one travels! Paris is not now further from us than Hamburg was some thirty years ago. When I was in Paris I found there sixteen or seventeen of my countrymen. O, how they kept together! Eleven of them dwelt in the same hotel: they drank coffee together, walked out together, went to the restaurateur's together, and took together half a bench in the theatre. That is the most foolish thing a person can do! I consider travelling useful for every one, from the prince to the travelling journeyman... The creative artist, the poet, the engineer, and the physician must travel... [but] those who cost the most generally are of the least use, and bring the country the least honor! I, thank God! paid for my journey myself, and am therefore free to speak my opinion!"(Andersen)

Paying for myself and the travels of my spouse, I echoed the sentiments of the fictional character Cousin Joachim. Would these students have been so ungrateful they were traveling individually? What if they had to work for their lodging? When they got home, would they utilize the events of their travels to enrich their daily lives and rituals? If not, the trip would largely be a waste. They could have saved a lot of money by visiting their closest beach.

Within our country's borders, teens and young adults struggle to find themselves and quantify their identity. In a society that increasingly smothers our children with unmerited praise, access to anything they desire and positive reinforcements for mediocre efforts, these struggling youths have little incentive to dig deeply and find their solution with determination and resolve. They become spoiled cretins that run to and fro on funds that they had no part in generating; wondering how great it is to travel when, in fact, they have not stepped one foot out of their bubble of security. The benefit of travel has been lost.

Have we turned our children over to themselves for development? Are we as a society, let alone parents, not responsible for building character in those to whom we hope to turn over the responsibility of a nation? If we are successful in getting our kids through 12 years of education, have we done enough?

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a mere 26.8% of the total population 25 and over has a bachelor's degree or higher. While this number is impressive when considering how many people worldwide are able to attend higher education, it is frightening when we realize that the remaining 74.2% have, at 25 or older, not completed any type of training or certification that would require them to broaden their perspective or spend time in a culture other than their own. By our own acceptance of these numbers, we reinforce the chances that three out of four encounters a non-American person has with an American will be one that perpetuates the stereotype of the arrogant, ignorant American. While it would be impossible to mandate college level educations for all, there are ways in which we can actively work to improve this current trend.

One of our greatest developmental tools in the battle against these stereotypes is independent travel. Such travel--where individuals are responsible for generating funding of their journeys while traveling--would encourage self-reliance, adaptation to unfamiliar culture, and a more realistic understanding of the boundaries of human capability. An acquaintance from high school saved her money to buy a ticket to Spain. Upon arrival, she spent a month working a variety of jobs to make the fare required to reach a friend's house in London. Working there for three months, she flew to the Washington D.C. area, where she stayed with a fellow classmate. When we visited with her, it was easy to see that a half year of travel had given her a sense of confidence and competency that we could not match. This small girl left big impressions in our minds as she parted for the next leg of the journey, which ultimately took over a year.

The experiences that we receive from our journeys are just as important as the ones we experience in the classroom. In an interview regarding the journeyman programs of certain European countries, human resources expert Hedley Malloch agreed. "Travel not only broadens the mind," he noted, "it expands the skills base, humanity and cultural awareness. It is travel, rather than manners, that makes the man." (Boucher)

In medieval times, a journeyman went from place to place looking for work from skilled artisans in the field which he hoped to master. There was no proven path for success; no arrangements were made beforehand for work or accommodations. Yet because he had acquired some level of proficiency, his position was superior and quite different from an apprenticeship, where an unskilled trainee worked for a specific amount of time under a specific master to gain the elements of the trade. Many men from all types of trades followed this time-honored tradition that crossed cultures, languages, and cultures; those men and women who still do participate in these traditions have talents that often outshine their peers.

Apprenticeship is not uncommon to the United States. In fact, many companies actively utilized in-house apprenticeships programs until the recession of the 1980's. Yet the wandering craftsman--a journeyman--is an idea that can only loosely be compared here to the availability of jobs for a union-affiliated craftsman, and it has never really caught on like it has in countries like France. Perhaps, as Malloch and others have, the concept is not one that is easily applicable to our culture (Boucher).

But it does have benefits that we so desperately need, benefits that are commonplace in almost every other area of the world. Madhu Singh's studies of work and learning in the informal economies of the third world showed that most participants in these economies gained their experience not from formal education, but from these types of informal, unsynchronized methods of training. These methods were catalysts for the enterprising elements essential for self-employment (Singh, p.602, 603).

Making this type of opportunity more common in America would help to refine and distinguish young administrators and leaders with a realistic, practical perspective. It also provides an impermanent workforce that can provide flexibility in many sectors of our country's more formalized economy. Even if focusing solely on the various cultures within our nation, we encourage the type of cultural awareness which builds networks that unite an often polarized nation. The outcomes of such experiences are sought after, as is seen in the marketability of those who have participated in City Year and other AmeriCorps initiatives. Expanding to neighboring countries could strengthen diplomatic ties and also give an edge to those who participate, as it has for those in Peace Corps.

In Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Robert Walton writes of the adventure which his travel expeditions have brought him, and adeptly explores the emotions and processes which brought him to the choices he made. For him, the journey itself was the experience from which there was something to gain, and the destination was simply a milestone to mark his progression. If we could instill this same passion for learning, understanding and gaining perspective in the youth of today, we could only improve our situation.

Not everyone can place their kids in private schools or send them on expensive overseas excursions. If my traveling companions in Central America were any indication, doing so wouldn't even bring us to the answer. With a renewed support for independent travel and study, however, we can develop the mentality of the overwhelming majority of our nation that has not had that experience through higher education. We can revive a sense of adventure and independence that has sat largely dormant since the era of continental exploration. In doing so, we take great strides in building a cultural awareness that leaves a greater reputation in our global society.

I started my yesterday at 6 am, getting to work early in order to leave before noon. I walked from work to a rental car office who was an hour late in providing me the car I reserved. I headed to Fru's job, grabbed some CDs from her car, and drove the two of us to Manhattan, through traffic, in about four hours. And then, about 2 hours later, I drove us back home. 

Why? In a word, friendship.

When we lived in Korea, Fru had a few students who took her out and about while I was gone for business. They gradually integrated into our social activities became good friends. One in particular was the group organizer, planning girl outings, taking the teachers' group for social outings, even recruiting students to join her in attending my religion class. An ambitious girl, she was offered a job in Seoul and moved away within days. We met with her on our last night in Korea and promised to stay in touch.

Her current company gives her occasional traveling opportunities, and this time she ended up at a trade convention in NYC. DC to New York is roughly the distance from Daegu to Seoul, so we decided to visit her this weekend. Unfortunately, plans changed, and she now was leaving Friday night, just before midnight. We adjusted our plans.

Car, tolls, parking, gas, meal; was it really worth it for 120 minutes with a friend? We say yes. <strong>The value of friendship should be greater than the requirements of maintenance.</strong> We'll most likely do this again when friends from Seattle and South Africa show up at our doorstep at some point this week (another change of plans; so we currently don't know when they'll arrive).

Unfortunately, an adherence to friendship of this intensity I've never seen in America. Every relationship of this level was either built in Korea or with people who have had the Korean experience. Those friends coming this week were fellow teachers in Korea (and not nearby, frequently associated friends), and the two other people who I can qualify with this kind of relationship are married to each other and were instrumental in our going to Asia.

I haven't decided yet whether the dominant factor in this friendship development is the high value of networks in Korean culture or the accommodating(commiserating?) bond that expatriates share. In either case, it's a factor that is nearly absent in American culture. It's hard enough getting my family to take a 90-mile trip to see me here, let alone friends in other regions of the country.

If there's any redeeming value to our lack of emphasis on maintaining personal relationships I'd love to hear about them.

It's true, folks, it's true. I've never heard it described that way, but, from my initial reaction, describing urban Korea as "a culture that believes it has a future" is the most accurate I've heard yet. 

In contrast... the US? Do we believe we have a future, or do we believe that we are the future? Are there ramifications to that slight difference in philosophy?

<blockquote>Cities, I feel, offer one of the most vivid and directly relatable examples of why diversity, mixing, randomness and human interaction are generally all good things, not variables to minimize. Places that rely on only one or two industries or that foster very little in the way of cross-cultural interaction limit themselves creatively and often bore themselves in the process. It may be tidy, efficient and cheap - like a shopping at a Wal-Mart - but it's hardly an enriching experience. </blockquote>

Now that the semester is done, I really feel a weight lifted from my shoulders. I've smiled more in the last three days than I have in the last three weeks. My younger sister will graduate this month from University of Delaware, beating me out for the title of first of our clan to have a Bachelor's. The tinge of defeat is swallowed by my admiration and pride.

So we both look towards the academic future. Her course is clearer and (at my last update) will take a turn towards medical sociology. My plans are slightly more esoteric; I haven't even found a title that accurately describes. I've thought about it a lot in the last week, however, and have summed up my ambitions to a simple statement: I'm interested in the study of communication and in providing culturally sensitive means for the communication process.

What does that mean? Well, we communicate in almost as many ways as there are people in the world. We express ourselves through words, gestures, sounds--even silence. We receive communication generally through three vehicles: visual, aural, and tacit feedback. As we funnel all those expressions through cultural filters and into those lonely three channels, there's lots of room for misinterpretation, ambiguity and inefficiency. Is it possible through anthropology and technology to develop some type of universal (cosmic?) compiler that translates with accuracy? Can I beat my message with a village drum to collaborate with your research stored on a computer? Can that collaboration be accessed real-time by someone who only speaks a southern African clicking language? How much loss can be avoided?

I believe that technology in its current manifestation is a "culture eraser," a machine that standardizes everything but inhibits diversity and dynamics. I want to help it through its metamorphosis, reaching a place where <a href="http://janchipchase.com/2006/12/shared-phone-use/">input depends upon what is natural to you</a>. I want to help develop a sustainable world that retains culture without restricting progress. This covers computer science, anthropology, futurology, international affairs, urban planning, communication... the list goes on and on.

I'll be honest and say that I'm not sure where to begin on such a convoluted endeavor, but I think the effort, if fruitful, would be greatly appreciated.

Fru and I were talking, and we noticed that nearly all of my friends and regular associates are either only children or the youngest sibling. There are a lot of characteristics that younger brothers or sisters possess, and we wondered if those traits were naturally attracted to the characteristics that I possess. I, of course, am an older brother.

I think the thing that makes me the most conscious of this phenomenon is the sheer amount of questions I field. Questions about life, relationships, work, philosophy, religion and health. Questions that, honestly, I probably am not qualified to answer and that for me, annoyingly, were time-consuming, researched arrivals rather than short, concise and packaged answers. 

To say I feel cheated would be accurate.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/21/science/21cnd-sibling.html?ex=1184040000&en=1a14817138e1ab5e&ei=5070">Recent studies</a> have implied that for this very reason, older siblings have a slight advantage in IQ. To be honest, I'd gladly exchange three points in IQ for a mentor or adviser, someone to whom I could ask the questions I'm pondering. 

In this next-generation, collaborative, internet-enabled world that I promote, it would seem that I'm collaborating with others more than they are collaborating with me. <em>Note to self</em>: find way to implement balance in collaboration philosophies.

"Jamon" is literally "ham," which adds a particularly interesting mental picture. 
I was thinking about this the other day in regards to my bit of pudge. I realize that 3-4 years ago I was doing a lot more dancing, running and other physical activity than I am now. Living in Korea--<a href="http://www.obesityresearch.org/cgi/content/full/12/12/1959">the land of thin</a>--helped me out while I was there, but now that I'm back and surrounded by "healthy" portions, processed food, and sugar levels that would just caramelize the Korean peninsula and <a href="http://www.epinions.com/content_4848001156">Asia in general</a>, I feel a need to get active again.

I won't go into <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/02/raising_the_bar.htm">previous discussions</a> about how I wrestle with that. I just wanted to share this video because the spanish title has potential to become a bit of a private encouragement between Fru and I; almost like a "give it your best."

How inspiring can this video be, however, when you know that getting healthy and exerting yourself physically is potentially lucrative to Nike? That they can spend a large sum of money making a video like this based on the return they expect--not based on their concern for your well-being. Is it really a commendable video when it is just showing your competitor (plastic surgery, medical body alteration) in a harsh light?

UPDATE: I spent the whole day talking about this presentation, but I never got around to discussing it here. So here's the comment a full day after I posted. Apologies.

I've been thinking about this ever since I read that article about <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/03/the_power_of_praise.htm">the power of praise</a>. Even before I listened to this rather entertaining visionary presentation, I have been thinking of how to shift my state of being from one dependent upon inherent skill to one that gives full effort without reserve. It's tough, and I'm not sure of any system created to address this for adults. Is our best hope, then, is that the development of those entering education now will be such that their creativity and innovation can help us, the aged, in the future?

Along with warm weather comes increased human activity. After New York and the trip to Central America, there was a weekend trip to New Jersey (wedding; Fru went while I stayed home), and the following weekend there was the trip to Virginia for our 10-year high school reunion, which I should probably post about. This weekend we entertained guests from my hometown, giving them the short tour of DC, and helped a friend move into the largest house I've ever had a friend own. 

The future doesn't look much clearer. This weekend is Fru's birthday, an O's game with friends, and a social outing with my coworkers and their families. The following weekend a friend from Daegu has business in Manhattan, so we most likely will head up there. Tentatively, we may be returning with some friends we made in Seoul who will crash at our pad for a few days while touring DC. And on and on the story goes.

Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on which side of the looming deadlines and examinations you are on), classes will be finished soon and I'll have a much-needed break from the daily double grind. I hope to slow down enough that I can really be thinking creatively by the time that GIEN comes around. 

I've postulated before that there is a definite <a href="http://wiki.leftsider.com/tiki-index.php?page=deliberateThought">benefit in taking time to think better</a>. At what point do we lose productivity to postulation? At what point does lack of thought create an efficiency nosedive? As I sit here, thoughts swirling, I'm not sure which aspect I should scale down and which I should further engage. Let's hope that May brings us answers.

Here's another lil' something I wrote for my intercultural communication class last week. I'll be presenting on it tomorrow. It's a cultural resume, explaining a culture in much the same way that an occupational resume would define you: in quick, rough summations and facts. In both cases, the hope is that the resume would pique your interest enough to prompt further investigation.

So with no further ado...
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
This cultural resume is an introduction to the culture of Korean Americans, defined as American residents of Korean origin. The first records of Korean immigration date back to 1903, when laborers arrived in the U.S. territory of Hawaii. The greatest influx of Korean immigrants, however, arrived after the acceptance of the 1965 Immigration Act. During this century of immigration, Korean Americans have become a small but well-established community in the United States.

While to the outside world it may be satisfactory to classify their community at this level, Koreans and Korean Americans themselves identify microcultures of 1, 2, and 1.5. These numbers refer to generation; an adult who immigrates to the United States would be considered a 1, while their American-born child would be considered a 2. The 1.5 classification falls upon those Korean-born individuals who were immigrants to the United States at an early age.

Outside of these microcultures are also at least two ancillary cultures: Koreans with mixed heritage or those who were adopted by families of non-Korean origin, and those who are not permanent residents but study or work in the United States. While the population of Korean Americans is generally quoted at around 1.4 million, including these other people groups increases the number of ethnic Koreans in the United States to approximately 2.1 million, according to the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

The Korean American community originally developed in the western regions of the U.S., including Hawaii. Even today, Los Angeles is home to more ethnic Koreans than any other place outside of Asia. Still, major Korean American communities have been established around the country, with the latest region with Korean American growth being the states in the south. The Washington, D.C., metropolitan area (combining Korean populations with Maryland and Virginia) has the third largest concentration of Koreans, bested by California and New York.

Korean Americans as a people group have one of the highest educational levels in the United States. Nearly half have a college degree or higher. Additionally they have been noted as a model minority for their sense of community and low levels of crime and unemployment. Much of this is attributed to cultural and ethnic rules and traditions. Koreans, says participant and film director Paul Kim, have “a commitment to persevere.”

America has often been portrayed as a land of opportunity for many people groups, and for many Koreans throughout recent history, America also represented hope of prosperity, evasion of invading cultures, and freedom from strong traditional norms. Yet South Korea has developed rapidly in the last 50 years and advanced stature in the international community. As a result, though America is still regarded highly for its academics, particularly in college and graduate studies, the number of immigrants to the United States in the last decade has dropped dramatically.

While Korean culture is definitely one of a collective ilk, the Korean American must walk the line between the traditional ethnic community and the geographically held perspective of individuality in order to achieve successful outcomes in American life. This can cause dissonance within and make it difficult, especially for 1.5 and second generation Korean Americans, to interact seamlessly with members of various circles.

Identity also is called into question, as even within the culture there are clear divisions based on birthplace and time spent in Korea. Kim, 28, and a U.S.-born Korean American, postulates that he and many others are part of a third culture. “I consider myself a third-culture individual, having been raised in two cultures, but whose intersection has created a unique culture of its own, and thus the Korean-American distinction. I identify with both groups, but also recognize the paradox of being neither.”

Many Koreans struggle to adapt to North American systems and values and may take years to feel fully integrated. Conversely, Korean Americans face difficulties when visiting Korea; their features render them completely indistinguishable from a native Korean, and, therefore, they are often expected to intrinsically follow cultural norms that are completely foreign to them. While one Korean American struggles to develop a more American perspective, another fights to remove the barriers between Korean Americans and Americans altogether. Still another Korean American takes a long trip back to their homeland to “become more Korean.” It’s easy to see where intra-cultural miscommunication can occur.

The search for identity, in itself, may be distinctly Korean American. In Korea, where the total non-Korean population is only 1.1%, the search for who you are is in nearly every face you will see. This only reinforces the collective qualities and principles of the Korean society. When asked what differences she found in Korean and Korean American cultures, survey participant Lee Soo Youn immediately commented, “Individualism. Korean people tend to share a number of things [with each other]. Meanwhile Ko-Ams tend to be more independent.”

Lee, 32, moved to the United States about ten years ago with her parents and younger brother. She has two degrees, one from a university in Daegu, South Korea, and the other from a design school in Washington, D.C. “I strongly feel I have both [Korean and Korean American] values and balance it well,” she says. “Yet if I only have one option to choose, I’d more likely consider myself Korean-American. I am comfortable being with and interacting with America and its society, and I’m willing to contribute personally to the society and communicate with Americans as a part of community.”

Her last statement speaks volumes. In the past, Korean Americans seemed reluctant to or disinterested in building personal relations with those of other people groups. Even today, it is not uncommon for a Korean parent to make a long commute from their home in an affluent suburb to a inner-city or low income community where they own and operate their family business (In 1990, 1 in 4 Korean Americans were self-employed, higher than any other ethnic group in America). In the late eighties and early nineties, tension grew between these business owners and community residents who felt that the Korean community was taking their money with no interest in their situation.

In the L.A. riots of 1992, more than 3,000 Korean businesses were destroyed as emotions flared about interracial justice and community. The first generation of 1.5 and 2-generation Korean Americans were beginning their professional lives around this time, and, having affinity to both Korean and American cultures, actively worked to bridge the gap between these groups that required a positive outcome.

In doing so, Korean Americans risk eroding their distinct culture. Korean American groups and organizations have been created to maintain and promote Korean history and language. “Those are major elements to reflect your identity,” says Lee. “If those two are missing in me, I am no longer Korean. I would technically be American without them.” Yet, according to the 2005 U.S. census, one in four Korean American households speak only English at home. With so much meaning and nuance embedded in the language, a lack of Korean language skills can not only mean a misunderstanding of personal culture but also a heightened propensity for miscommunication when interacting with 1-generation and Korean nationals.

One way that Korean Americans have found to maintain intra-cultural ties is through worship. Even though Christianity is still considered a minority religion in Korea, seventy to eighty percent of Korean Americans attend church, mostly protestant. These religious groups create social networks that provide activity groups, professional services, and even modes of acquiring housing or sponsorship for new immigrants. Of the three participants I questioned, all had parents who were active church attendees and one participant was professionally employed by their denomination. Two participants were protestant, and one was catholic.

This predisposition to connect and interact in such a way as to imply a cohesive role may be one of the reasons why both Koreans and Korean Americans think of the successes and failures of one to be addressed by all—regardless of location. Recently, a 1.5-generation Korean American killed 33 people including himself. Korean American organizations expressed expected concern and regret. But, surprisingly to many Americans, Koreans in South Korea also expressed their shame and guilt. The president of the Republic of Korea sent at least three messages of condolence to the U.S., and the Korean ambassador to the U.S. vowed to fast for 32 days—apparently a day for each victim. Previously, a Korean American of mixed heritage was praised in South Korea for being named Most Valuable Player at the Superbowl. Though he had never been back to Korea and had little cultural understanding, many in South Korea considered him a hero.

Says Kim, “I don’t think there is such a thing as a definitive distinction between Korean and Korean-American culture. It is not about differences or similarities. It is rather a sequential progression from the other, and a small continuum in the overall development of humanity.”

Indeed, in a country as culturally diverse as the United States, the path of the Korean American is one of many sequential progressions to an overall development of Humanity.

For the past couple of days I've been playing around with <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda">Coda</a>, the new all-in-one web development solution from <a href="http://www.panic.com/">Panic</a>. I have a lot of admiration for the Panic team, and the idea of a simple, multi-faceted application intrigued me.

I have to admit, I don't do much webdev anymore. There were times where all I would do was code, code, code. Nothing serious, this was a long time ago so it was largely HTML and basic Javascript. I still remember saving up my nickels to buy that first Macromedia suite. Then I tried freelancing and got burned enough that I lost interest in anything even related to webdev. My skills rusted, and Dreamweaver made it so easy to go WYSIWYG that I found myself only switching to code to make minor tweaks whenever I did work on a website.

Coda has singlehandedly reinvigorated my interest in coding. As I wrap my head around its features, I can see how this app would handle most everything that I would need to do at my level of skill. In fact, this past week I've removed my Adobe and Macromedia apps (which I don't use all that much these days anyway) and used this application in exclusivity.  Aside from finals and papers, this is the big reason I've not been updating for the last week or so--I've been coding, and man, am I out of shape. When I get back to form, you'll definitely see it in a less frankenstein version of Leftsider (along with a few other projects I've been brewing).

This weekend Fru and I met up with friends and attended a baseball game at <a href="http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/american/oriole.htm">Camden Yards</a>. I'm not a baseball fan in the loosest sense of the word, but I find watching a game at the stadium infinitely more interesting than seeing it on TV; the people-watching opportunity is excellent, and it's nice to get out into the fresh air once in a while.

One of the interesting aspects of stadium culture is vendor interaction. The vendor is an anomaly; very few places are left in America where you strap your goods to your person and wander around announcing your wares at the top of your lungs. Because of the concentrated audience that they cater to, they develop interesting means of transferring goods and cash. A hot dog may be held by a half-dozen people before reaching its recipient; I attended a Yankees game last fall where the peanuts vendor rifled bags to customers and then walked up to get the cash that would be passed to the end.

It says a lot that in a crowded area full of strangers we have developed a social norm where we trust each other with handling our food and giving the entirety of the money we send to its intended receiver. To what extent are we willing to rely on the cooperation of others to facilitate a successful outcome? Is this beneficial only in the bleacher section during the fourth inning, or could it potentially be translated into other applications outside of this setting? Would I be willing to have strangers touch my food before I receive it (think delivery)? Would I trust someone other than the billing company to take the money I intend for the bill (think cornerstore/supermarket <a href="http://www.moneygram.com/MGICorp/ConsumerProducts/UtilityBillPayment/index.htm">bill services</a>)?

The system's efficiency stood out to me as a family of four seated a few rows ahead of us ordered food. The mother was particularly indifferent to (uninformed of?) the system and insisted on stepping in front of, reaching over and across. When a gentleman reached for her cash to pass on, she hesitated before allowing him to facilitate. I think that, especially as we ascend economically, our level of trust in the common man has eroded to a level that we cannot comfortably depend upon each other. This is a loss for humanity in the long term.

Every so often I get inspired to really get down and do something spectacular. Generally, these inspirations are squashed by lunchtime. 

Today was no different. Holiday; I'm thinking chill at home and get some stuff done. In fact, I was so excited by the concept that I woke up at 6:30 and got straight to work. My goals? To start working on a Leftsider redesign, and to start rearranging the furniture around the apartment (something we do periodically in a quest for feng shui zen perfection).

Hopped on the computer, noted a conversation about the CMS system <a href="http://expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a>. Hey, why don't I install that locally and try it out? Sounds like a good idea. Except I haven't set up my <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/">development environment on the MacBook</a>... need to install MySQL, PHP, update Apache and Perl.

But wait... isn't there something for OS X that does this all in one install? Was it <a href="http://locomotive.raaum.org/">Locomotive</a>? no, that's for Ruby on Rails. Aha! It was <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/home.php">MAMP</a>! Let's install it and we'll be on our way.

Well MAMP installs no problems, but EE isn't sensing the setup. Tweak here; nothing. Move this to there; nope. Remove and reinstall EE; nada. This is the part of the story where my bleary eyes can bore holes through lead. I become super-analytical and, unfortunately for my wife, start obsessing over minute details both on and off the screen.

The fam calls and reminds me that today is my grandfather's birthday. So I walk away from the problem and head over to Delaware to spend the afternoon with him and others celebrating. Good times. Head back as the sun sets and the whole country seems to be shooting off fireworks.

Get back, sit down, go back at the problem--but to no avail. The number of accessible, Mac-familiar webdev folks in my social circles is pretty slim, so I have yet to even get to the site redesign stuff.

While the trip back home was great, it did waste the time I had for rearranging my pad. So now I've got 0 to show for my day. Sometimes I wonder why we even try.
<strong>
UPDATE:</strong> 20 minutes this morning on my old iBook (which I manually installed MySQL and PHP rather than going the contained dev environment route) and EE is working. I must be doing something wrong with MAMP.

	When you've got three days to explore dozens of islands, the schedule fills up fast. It was not helpful when it decided to rain the entirety of the first day. The next day the troops were eager to get out there--somewhere--and enjoy Bocas.<br />
<br />
We hooked up with some ladies that Tav had met while waiting at the docks and visited the islands Zapatilla and Red Frog. Good times. Everyone was pretty tired afterwards. It was Good Friday as well, so everything was closed and, to everyone else's chagrin, alcohol was not for sale. So it was a pretty quiet night for all.

	This pic is from Fru's photostream, where you can see other pics of our vacation.<br />
<br />
Saturday morning Fru and I said goodbye to Tav and headed out to catch a water taxi back to mainland. We were on our way to Changuinola to catch a bus that went directly back to San Jose. You see, it was my great-grandmother's birthday, and I had yet to see her.<br />
<br />
We tried as best we could, but by the time we put bags down in our hotel there were only 45 minutes left of visitation hours at the center where she stays. I was more than a bit disappointed, but there's only so much that you can do, right?<br />
<br />
So instead I dropped the little gift I had brought for her at my cousin's house. Turns out I was able to see my cousin and partner in crime, Fernando, who turned up with his girlfriend and daughter (who didn't exist last time I saw them!). We had a good time talking, and I think I almost convinced him to come up and stay in DC sometime soon. ^^<br />
<br />
6am the next morning I was at the airport, with apparently every other tourist in a 100km radius, heading back to Newark. We bused back to Silver Spring and cabbed it home. When I woke up on Monday morning I knew I was home but didn't have a clue what I was supposed to do or what language I was supposed to be speaking (I had been studying japanese the night before). It took about 4 days before I finally caught up with myself.<br />
<br />
All in all, not the vacation I had planned, but a good vacation nonetheless. Tav spent another day in Bocas and then flew directly to San Jose to catch his flight home. When he reached LA, he sent a text message that said it all: "No mas Pura Vida. *sigh*"

<blockquote>Soon we will gather in front of our televisions and watch receivers run over the middle and linebackers dive headfirst at loose footballs. We will tell ourselves we could do this too, if we were paid millions, or if we were famous, or if we took steroids. But we'll forget how the game of football is born out of hunger, and courage, and desperation, and community, and hope. And how sometimes it's played in spite of everything else.

This is the kind of story that makes me realize how much I have forgotten of my upbringing. While I did not live anywhere near here or do anything similar, it bears the distinct feeling of survival approaching art that I remember as a child. That I attached to everyday people who stood as heroes in my early mind and heard about in stories.

Occasionally I wonder if the efficiency and advancement that technology brings is worth the loss of these basic, even primal, characteristics. The heroes of my formative years have bent with age, and their successors have abandoned the form (myself included). Is it a time forever lost?

To what extent does the reduction of poverty and suffering stifle the human capacity to persist and expand. Can I still be hungry when my needs have been met?

BODY:
The slowdown that Leftsider has been experiencing is largely due to the glut of deadlines looming over my head like a weary ghost. Since I must appease these academic spirits with APA-format incantations, I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone and post a few here. Feel free to read at your whim.

The first was written quite some time ago, but it is relatively light. It was in reference to <a href="http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200702/200702160007.html">this editorial piece</a> in the Chosun Ilbo.

=========

During my time in South Korea, I took every opportunity I could find to explore the culture, traditions and natural beauty of the peninsular country. When resources would permit, I would also take  advantage of the country's location to leapfrog to neighboring Asian countries--to see what wonderful treasures they held and experience their unique perspectives on life. As I did this, one thing was always beside me as a consistent object of familiarity; the 할머님(Korean grandmother) and 할아버지님(Korean grandfather).

South Koreans often refer to retirement as a second childhood; one that allows them to shrug off the responsibilities and burdens that they have shouldered and live out their remaining years as they wish--and as their investments have provided. It explains why most tourist areas in
the country are swarming with seniors in small groups or on tours and attempts an accommodating explanation for their cantankerous and often nearly shameless behavior. Their small, bent frames testify to the dues they have paid  in the rapid development of one of Asia's largest economies; it is only fitting to allow them their declining years in wandering, wine and revelry.

Chosun Dailly columnist Hong-Sub Choi writes that South Korea does itself a disservice by not employing well into elderly ages. He looks at the veritable ocean of wisdom and experience that they hold and asserts that it is best used by reentry into the Korean workforce. Looking at other countries who are pushing back the age of retirement or who currently allow workers to continue well into their years, he sees his own country at a loss by not putting this demographic back on the job.
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
Choi looks towards the actions of other states as an indication of South Korean inefficiency, not as responses to their own problems. He does not recognize the cultural differences of European countries that would not provide for the same level of stability and freedom for their aged. He also overlooks the fact that, like South Korea, Japan is a rapidly aging country. In a much more dire situation, Japan is doing all that it can to sustain its maturing population. South Korea has both a distinct advantage and an admirable difference that allows this phenomenon to be; yet listening to this argument, it would seem that it is true that the grass is always greener on the other side.

This second childhood is a sign of success; the right of the retired and a responsibility of the current working class. To remove it from the traditions of the Korean community would be the greater disservice to society and yet another casualty of the uniformity of globalization. There are better ways that the public could be served by the wisdom and experience of the previous generation, and a holistic approach is favorable over one that places weight on those back which have already carried so much.

In other areas of the world, there is a looming uncertainty that hangs over retirement. In western philosphies, individualistic agendas and allegiance to industry and the almighty dollar has left little room for family, let alone provision for those before us. African and Asian cultures whose principles are built around the importance of the community have a built-in structure for respecting elders and make provisions for their care. This gives those further in years the option to rest from their toils or to continue contributing to their society. They do what makes them happy; working becomes a method of comfortability instead of a matter of necessity, as it is for many older people around the world.

Even in countries where community is not as significant, there continues to be a concept of reaping the benefits of a life of hard work. South Korean seniors are a working model of such a reward for labors. A family raised successfully, in tandem with wise investments, means a life of ease in the end. Their ability to travel even in their later years is a testament to healthful living and hearty character. Truly, they act as ambassadors when traveling to various resorts and destinations, showing to all who see them that there is an element in Korean society that provides longevity in well-being.

In turn, these elders are stimulating their minds by exposing themselves to new locations, experiences, and cultures. It is well documented that constant mental stimulation is essential to clarity of mind and elasticity into our later years. This travel provides much needed neurological exercise while allowing them to apply a mature and experienced eye to the cultures which they interact with. Such assessment would be the perfect way to utilize the wisdom of this age group, as their reflections may have a distinct profundity that is cultivated from their life experiences. Additionally, they would be less likely to stay abroad to take advantage of the cultures they experience than a young student or a professional with a career still ahead of him.

To be truthful, the current generation's neglect of the teachings of the previous generation in total acceptance of a more global worldview is a large factor in the workforce issues that Choi presents. Abandonment of familial responsibilities and traditions have placed increasing strain on the social structure of Korean society. As has happened Japan, the current generation is increasingly abandoning their duties to their parents, leaving them to fend for themselves. If this is to continue unchecked, then the discussion here is moot; Korean grandparents will find themselves forced to work in order to survive. Rather than enjoying the fruits of their labor, they will find that their labor is fruitless and endless, as it is for many in other parts of the world.

Adaptation of individualistic goals have squeezed the size of the Korean family smaller and smaller, and the priority of a family has been lessened. The lower birth rate in rapidly developing states such as Korea and Japan is the issue that would be better addressed than that of whether our aged should be re-employed. An increase in value to the family would also provide seniors with an outlet to share their experiences and perspectives, passing down their knowledge to a new generation.

Of course, this is not to say that the old ways cannot be adjusted. What is needed is a balanced approach that is sensitive to both the developments of the modern world as well as the established practices that can be hailed as progressive. There still is room for improvement in both areas. If more experience and talent is needed to bolster the workforce, perhaps an accelerated path to equality between genders would be a more productive effort. There are many capable workers who are not seen as equal to their peers, and are often forced into a semi-retirement long before the retirement age is attained. Provisions to symbiotically tap into the abilities of those Koreans who are of mixed heritage should also be addressed.

In short, retirement is the second childhood that we all deserve. It should not be discredited solely because of an international tendency, nor should society's elders be forced to use their wisdom experience because our generation has neglected to accept their discipleship and training. South Korea has a unique opportunity to stand as a beacon to a successful method and should preserve it rather than sacrifice it.

I think the elderly should be able to make their own decision in if they want to keep working or not.
In Germany they get pushed and pushed to older ages. A goal most of them never reach to begin with... :(

I like the idea of second childhood. Never knew that.
Maybe because I didn't see many happy retired people in Waegwan ;)

I eschew suburbia. The more I think of it, the less I find of it that is redeeming. Unless it is pulsing, breathing, teeming with people it should not be considered a viable option for community.

People who hear me say this think that I live in the city. I do not. Some of those who actually know where I live have considered my surroundings to be quite urban. I'm less inclined to disagree with them and more apt to remind them that the concentration that exists in my environment is a result of <em>urban spread</em>, the aftereffect of suburban sprawl. I'd like to move closer to the heart of the city when location, resources and logistics permit.

I grew up in the country. Coming from the town (pop. <500) limits, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/2314012/in/set-58171/">my house</a> was the first house on the left side of the road. This confused city folk because my house was more than a mile from that intersection. It was also shaded by tall trees and brush, making it not immediately noticeable. I spent my days riding my bike in circles around our yard, reading on a blanket under the trees, making hideouts under the back porch. I loved my environment but longed for human interaction. When the opportunity came, I moved toward the city. I met friends and neighbors, but still lived within a quiet community that largely kept to itself.

In 2004, Fru and I relocated to South Korea.  For the first time, I came to know what city living meant. It meant close quarters, with overlap between <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/blog/archives/2006/08/post_115.html">private, public and shared space</a>. It meant required--not optional--interaction with people I crossed; dealing with compatibilities and incompatibilities that had nowhere to go but right out in the open. It meant activities every weekend, every weeknight. And, thanks to certain measures made (albeit in an ethically questionable manner), the beauty of my childhood was never far away. In many cases that farmland/woodland area could be reached even by public transport. 

A few days in Tokyo brought an epiphany in the form of <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/urbannature/pool/tags/japan/">urban nature</a>--the outside that could be brought inside, the fusion of nature and society. I was entranced by the beauty and flow that seemed to blend what in my mind had been competing entities into a harmonious tapestry.

Returning to the US, in this respect, has been nothing but suffering. I live in a place that people call "city" but is miles from the city center and train station, has mediocre bus access (about eight routes within a 1/2-mile radius but only coming every 30 minutes at best) and minimal pedestrian attention. Privatized transportation companies and airports are convenient to the city center but not to the individual; the whole society is built around the car--not people.

On a weeknight, it's rare to see a spontaneous activity. And rightly so; it would require leaving your house, getting in your car, traversing the highway just to see a face. In contrast, an evening activity required a bus or train jaunt to the city center at worst; in many cases it merely required a <em>five-minute walk</em> down the street.

I think that people have forgotten about people. We live in our big suburban quarters (which are compartmentalized by personalized rooms where we can "express our individuality), not even knowing our neighbors, driving individually to work with our iPods plugged to the stereo, sit in cubicles all day, eat lunch at a chain restaurant that makes the dish the same way, everyday, no matter which location we order from. Our children, and especially teens, have no afterschool outlets for developing social interaction skills except an occasional community playground and or local strip mall/shopping center, provided they can find a ride there. We have separated ourselves to a point that the differences in siblings seem diverse. We have no world view because, in truth, we live in our own worlds.

If I injure my ankle, I will feel discomfort when using it. But if I avoid using it because of the discomfort, eventually it will just get weaker and weaker until it no longer is useful at all. The muscles will atrophy and its effectiveness will vanish. In comparison, there are many societal ills that are more than just discomforting. To date, our solution has been to run away to a more conducive environment. Suburbia is the attempt to make a new better place rather than to improve the existing. It is a way to avoid uncomfortable choices that we need to face. I don't know about you, but any choices that I have purposely avoided have never left me feeling anything but cowardly.

People need to understand that there are <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/03/confessions_of_an_emptynester.htm">ramifications to their choices</a>. Consequences that impact not just the environment but also their own families, their own perspectives. Maybe they won't end up sharing my hatred for the suburbs (I'm currently wrestling with the potential that lies in planned suburban communities), but they can help to develop a remedy for the maladies our current plan is causing.

Do you know the difference between elasticity and plasticity? 

Elasticity is the tendency of material to temporarily deform when placed under stress. It spreads, it stretches; it alters to accommodate the strain.

Plasticity is the tendency of a material to retain deformation it has received. Think clay, putty; it retains the shape or can be re-shaped into something entirely new. The point at which a material's elasticity turns into plasticity is considered that object's yield.

Both could be useful traits in life. One, however, is not progressive. <strong> How far you go is limited--and often less valuable--if your intention is to return back to your original state.</strong> Moreover, would you rather the plasticity in your life be deliberate (think adapting like putty) or a consequential <em>yield</em>?

Things I'm thinking about (though perhaps not in the way intended), thanks to that wise sage <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/blog/archives/2007/05/alignment_ident.html">Jan</a>.

<blockquote>When George Thomas was eight he walked everywhere.

It was 1926 and his parents were unable to afford the fare for a tram, let alone the cost of a bike and he regularly walked six miles to his favourite fishing haunt without adult supervision.

Fast forward to 2007 and Mr Thomas's eight-year-old great-grandson Edward enjoys none of that freedom.

He is driven the few minutes to school, is taken by car to a safe place to ride his bike and can roam no more than 300 yards from home.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The word "globalization" is used in Korea to the point that it could make your ears bleed. The Korean version of globalization has a passive connotation, given that we normally begin discussing it by saying, "In the globalized era, in order to survive limitless competition..."

That passive understanding of the concept is shattered when you see how many people are engaged in such intense debate inside and outside the summit hall, where the global order is actually being created. I was a little unhappy when I saw not a single Korean among all these people -- the world leaders creating a new world order, NGO workers voicing their views on the policy-making process, college students studying international politics on site and cultivating their own understanding of it all.</blockquote>

I'd like to thank the Communication department of the Seventh-day Adventist church for inviting me and allowing me to present at their 2007 forum for their Global Internet Evangelism Network. It was a great opportunity to connect with a small but growing set of individuals that are poised to bring the denomination to a fuller potential.

The GIEN forum is an annual meeting that allows the communication directors, media professionals and tech heads of the Adventist church to come together and discuss the internet as a new medium for evangelism. Basically it sounded to me like people wanting to figure out how to use your computer to baptize you. Because let's face it: Adventist pastors and administrators are not anywhere near the top of the list of people you think of when you think of Web2.0. Everything I saw about this thing, including the old website (and even <a href="http://gien.adventist.org">the new one</a>, really), announced the disconnect that the church has with the internet.

If the descriptions of previous attendees are accurate, this year was a real departure from the previous sessions. <a href="http://spectrummagazine.typepad.com/the_spectrum_blog/2007/06/the-spectrum-bl.html">Alexander</a> notes that the list of presenters was relatively young and tech-savvy. It was indeed encouraging to see peers with a bead on the various aspects of the web. We converged and departed in different areas, but it gave the theological postulation squad something new to consider and various sides of the argument.

My personal message at the forum was that the internet is increasingly social. This is because the internet is increasingly becoming our real life. Less and less do you hear the idea of the virtual world because what we do online now has ramifications in the physical, tangible world. If church leaders continue to consider the internet and its communities and philosophies as novel and gameplay, they will soon find themselves alienated from not only those who the wish to reach but also those within who are also increasingly involved with technology.

I presented a workshop, "Developing Adventism in and through Online Social Networks," that gave these administrators a quick primer on what an SNS is, why and how it works, and the pros and cons for both involvement with an existing SNS or a self-made, exclusive SNS setting. Turnout was good, the mood was excellent. I would have fared better if I had brought my old iBook instead of my MacBook; technical shenanigans ate 5-10 minutes of what would have been great discussion.

I made a concentrated effort to push my message in every side conversation. Finally, I think it started to break through. I also kept promoting the ideas of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learnmore/">creative commons</a> and <a href="http://www.studies-observations.com/everyware/">ubiquitous computing</a>, so that these guys can be thinking about tomorrow instead of scrambling about today.

All said, I don't think it could have gone any better. Next year is slated for the African continent. I'm excited about that as I haven't been to Africa in about seven years. I hope to be invited again, based on the success of this iteration. We'll see what happens.

I'll be posting my presentation soon, both here and on the GIEN site. I'll announce it when I get back to the states.

My question to you is...what are the action steps needed to make the church relevant in today's web environment. How do we harness (lol) the resources we have to achieve a presence that attracts a community to take an interest in substantive interaction?

Hey leftsider, 

Good to meet you at the forum. I wish that I could have attended your presentation. Your comment during the panel discussion about importing collaboration models from the creative commons community should get more attention. 

I like what netAdventist is doing in supplying a common platform, but I think that we can push this farther by taking advantage of emerging social networks to intentionally crowdsource the meanings of Adventist culture.

@mrking2
Step one: stop making action steps, especially those that only apply to your organization.
Step two: invest resources (time, thought) into crash-coursing your way to familiarity in current internet trends.
Step three: Actively participate in the community. Which is not the same as copying the community, leeching from the community, etc.

If we do that, the attractiveness will be there. Guaranteed. This is God's message we're talking about here. 


@Alexander
I like that term "crowdsource"; but when has Adventism ever been defined by its adherers? That's dangerous talk there, my new friend. Can you imagine what would happen if Adventism became user-defined?

Greater realization of faith?
More visible Christian action?
Visibility and value outside of our religious sphere?

We really do need to push this farther. I argued to a certain degree in the Ethics breakout group that the internet is a testbed for the upcoming philosophies of society. What they consider to be "the moral and ethical void of the web" is really the foundation upon which new principles will be discovered and tested before implementation in the tangible world. What goes a step further is the NEED for individual interpretations (be they accurate or historical fiction) that build the consensus of who we are. Before I go any further, let me just make this a new blog post.

Lefty,

I consider steps two and three to be helpful action steps because they both suggest taking initiative...hence the whole "action" tag.

You've given some good feedback here. The involvement of social interaction in both a virtual and literal community is an appropriate assimilation of Adventistm with the world outside the SDA bubble. I hope to do my part instead of whining and complaining about the church being behind the times.

Cheers,
Marvin

BODY:
This is the second time that I've visited London. The first was a 14-hour layover on my way to eastern Africa. With such short time and a need to move from Heathrow to Gatwick airports, I really was limited in what I could do. I caught the train from Heathrow to Picadilly Circus and wandered around aimlessly, dropping pounds (currency, not fat) as I went. Then, I headed back, and before you knew it I was gone.

This time, I went for the GIEN 2007 forum, which wasn't actually in London but in <a href="http://www.plazes.com/plazes/26481:coppid_beech_hotel">Bracknell</a>. Bracknell is to the London city area what Columbia or Fredricksburg is to the DC metropolitan area: not really in it. So a trip to London required an hour train ride and, yes, yet more pounds. 

It would seem that London does not want to have a relationship with me. For all its history, style and status, it is somewhat difficult to ascertain, aloof and exclusive. Part of this I lay on the fact that it is the only country I've been to whose currency far outvalues the US dollar; so, in effect, I may be experiencing what everyone else experiences, well, everywhere else.

To its merit, I have little to say that is negative about Englanders. They are particularly humorous, down to earth and very approachable. I found this a much-needed salve for my bruised British interactions.

Would I go again? Absolutely? Soon? No, not soon. I'll wait for the terror activities to die down and (hopefully) the dollar to have a more favorable exchange rate.

Another TED video (they're great!). Although this is a really old one that I've seen before (and was reminded of when I saw Jeff in <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4217348.html">this video</a> about Microsoft's "Milan" project) the thing I want to note about his presentation is that about halfway in he says that he cringes when he thinks about the $100 computer being sent out developing countries because in this day and age <strong>no one should ever have to conform to hardware in order to communicate</strong>.

Indeed, my latest fascination is with understanding <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/05/now_that_the_semester_is.htm">how we can make technology culturally transparent
</a> so these kind of things really make me feel like a kid in a candy store. Can you imagine how life will be when that Milan table costs $500 instead of $5000? With the operating system built for multiple input, would one $500 Milan table be worth more than five $100 computers (which are hopefully much more advanced than the current version)?

Will we still need <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/06/elasticity_plasticity.htm">plasticity</a> when we create a communicative medium that interprets our input in a way that is native to us and outputs it in a way that is familiar to the recipient? Just a thought. :)

It would be very easy for me to live my life in a bubble. I work 8-10 hours a day at a job 1 mile from my home. In the evenings I do classes; on the weekends I travel or fulfill other obligations. I could go for a very long time without seeing something new. So, to combat sterilization, I walk and take public transportation a lot. I cannot choose who will be on the bus. It's a random sampling of society, everyday.

There are two things I see on the bus everyday. 

<ul><li><strong>People like me.</strong> People who have my style, my concerns. People who are worried about their friends and family, about personal and social issues. I see people who are struggling to be as much as they can be--for their families, for themsleves. I honor and respect them, and draw my strength from them.</li>
<li><strong>People like me.</strong> People who don't seem to be going very far. People who see like me, but are biased by ignorance. People who could do so much more if they only pushed a little further. People trapping themselves in situations. Who just need to stop complaining and do something--for their community, for their families, for themselves. I have disdain for them, and they sap life from my bones.</li></ul>

I see myself in both sets (which often overlap), and it causes a dissonance within. One that makes me want to do my best and give up hope at the same time. One that reach out and yet pull away. I'm not quite sure how to deal. I end up with a lot of things on my mind and no real way to identify or explain them. I'm not really sure what to do about it either.

<blockquote>Between the 4th and 12th of April 2007 5,949 members of DIMSDRIVE Research’s internet monitor panel completed a private survey. 53.6% of the sample was female, 0.9% in their teens, 14.2% in their twenties, 33.3% in their thirties, 31.0% in their forties, 14.2% in their fifties, and 6.4% aged sixty or older. 47.9% lived in thieir own (or their family’s, etc) home, 17.1% in a purchased flat or apartment, 3.9% in a rented house, and 28.3% in a rented apartment. 2.8% lived in other types of accomodation.</blockquote>

I wonder if there are any surveys regarding American gardening tendencies, especially <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/10/balcony.htm">in urban areas</a>. 

I've never really been a particularly meticulous gardener, even when I did live in the country. I do, however, feel there is something therapeutic about caring for plants. Whenever I get one, I tend to treat it as if it were my own flesh and blood, which may be why I usually don't purchase them for myself.

This month, however, I did buy a plant from a friend who grows Indian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine">jasmine</a>. She took some cuttings, tended them until they took root, and then gave it to me. It really does look just like some cuttings stuck in dirt right now, but I'm hoping to see some growth eventually. Another thing for me to pine over. 

This officially brings our family plants to four; my jasmine and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/390397889/in/set-72157594536058993/">my tropical fern</a> I inherited from my in-laws, and Fru's two bonsai trees; one is <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/390399179/in/set-72157594536058993/">indoors</a> and one is <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leftsider/390406552/in/set-72157594536058993/">on the patio</a>.

There are a lot of normal people living in a home without walls. We can see everything that goes on and we don’t like it. First, we don’t like the fact that there are people living such miserable lives in this age of wealth and technology. But second, we don’t like to see the common struggles of society, such as substance abuse, disease, and violence in such plain sight. These things happen to people in all walks of life - in nice neighborhoods as well as bad - and perhaps in more subtle ways. But is it any better to have abuse or violence happen behind the facade of a cozy bungalow? Do we prefer to pretend that the cute porches of a traditional neighborhood represent the harmonious and happy existence of our society?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Labour ministry officials and prosecutors discovered more than 1,100 workers working 14 hours a day and living in conditions described as "appalling".

It is the largest such raid in Brazil, a country beset by the problem of slave labour.

Officials said that the labourers lived in overcrowded conditions with no proper sanitation facilities.</blockquote>

Only marginally related to the previous entry, right?

On the plane to London I did a little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_Mapping">mindmapping</a> and came up with a new idea that I thought I'd share. Starting now, I will work to remove the word "web" from my conversation about computers and the internet. Here's why.

When I think of a web, I think of a spider. She puts up a web to ensnare unsuspecting bugs. These bugs wander around, get caught, and can't get away. The spider then sucks them of all life, leaving their hollow carcasses wrapped and blowing in the wind. She must do this, for if she didn't, she would die.

Does this sound like the internet that you use?

It was a nice analogy when things were small and all about lines and dots that connect. It was barely OK when people used the internet for placing static information in a billboard-like display (you're not still doing this, <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/homepagegoals">are you</a>?). But now, as we step out of the hoo-ha of "Web2.0" and into the actual application of a collaborative, user defined/defining, customizable interaction with the internet, it is way beyond its freshness date and must be replaced.

Internet, actually, is a wonderful word that is much more aptly suited (see? This isn't me trying to coin a new buzzword!). It combines the concept of a network with the prefix implication that things cross boundaries and connect separated worlds. It is a wonderful to say what the internet is: A medium that takes information to infinite locations and allows us to virtually take that journey as well.

What do we encounter when we take that journey? Increasingly, we are seeing the real lives of many people and the issues and situations of many more. We receive this information and utilize it to gain and awareness all--not just our own, not just those who are online. 

Other people are doing this. <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/blog/archives/2007/07/todays_office_2.html">Nokia</a> is doing this. Nokia is a company that sells mobile devices. They are following people from around the world in order to understand them better before offering services/solutions to them. Why wouldn't a religious organization want to develop the same level of understanding? Wouldn't it make sense to know who you're talking to and what their situation is before you offer them a solution? Perhaps if we did <a href="http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2006/11/nokia_world_opk.html">figures like these</a> wouldn't have been so eye-opening last week. 

The other importance to the bilateral communication that the internet allows is not just what the story is but how they tell it. What happens to us theoretically happens to everyone, but how we share those events, ideas, and perceptions is what gives us identity. <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/identitymatters/">Identity matters</a>, especially when the internet is a real part of your life. And as our online and offline identities merge (as a result of social networks, we have to realize the importance of truth/untruth, storytelling and historical revision to personal identity (<a href="http://infovore.org/talks-pdf/telling-stories-print.pdf">pdf link</a>). We've learned this in tangible living; the internet is developing through these lessons <a href="http://sarahcpr.com/?p=45">as we speak</a>.

Yes, this collaborative, self-defining nature is a threat to organizational control, but it is necessary for involvement in what is becoming a universal norm. Big media has realized this with amazing rapidness and made changes to move to a more accommodating strategy. I think it is time for all of us to catch the wave.

<blockquote>Right now it seems like Facebook is the new place to be. And right now I'm asking myself, "Why would I want to go anywhere else? This place is great!" My bet is that Facebook too, like any trendy nightclub, will fade out and there will be yet another cool online nightclub equivalent to join. Which begs the question, should social networks just do what nightclubs do every two years and just shut down and start over?</blockquote>

Interesting concept. How permanent should a social network be? Does it have a shelf life, or are creators obligated to keep it going?

BODY:
People are slowly finding out that I'm leaving my job at the end of September. Most people don't ask why; rather, they ask what I am doing next. Unfortunately, there are many assumptions that these people make based on the reputation my department has for being a tough department to work for, full of cattiness, politics, and stress.

All of these things are true, mind you, but they are not the reason that I am leaving. I don't have a problem with any of those things in my department--at least no more than I have with a mosquito bite. I have learned to deal with the ways in which people work and can be effective regardless. The reason I'm leaving, actually, is for my education.

A few weeks back, I took a credit-by-examination test which allowed me to skip a prerequisite and have access to a few more classes I'd like to take. Subsequently, in addition to my Asian Philosophy, Critical Approaches to Literature and The Religious Quest courses I have added Electronic Publishing and Internet and Web Design (courses I probably could have CLEPed as well, but should probably review). I now have a max load of 18 credits, which is practically impossible to do with a static full-time job. 

Additionally, I've been looking at graduate programs. One that has really caught my eye is the <a href="http://www.cca.edu/academics/graduate/design/">Design program at California College of the Arts</a>. I'm not going to go into why this is so attractive to me; I'll merely suggest looking past the preconceived notion of what an academic design program entails and focusing on how important design is to experience and the representations of both our technological futures and our cultural pasts. The program requires a portfolio of works, obviously, so I hope to create something worthwhile through my freelancing between now and then. While this job deals with communication, design and intercultural issues, what I would have done in this position could not have been submitted as part of my work. So, I'll go it alone.

That being said, this job was not for me. We are adaptable creatures, able to adjust to whatever is given us; that does not mean that what we can accommodate is our ideal. I am grateful to my director for remembering my work in times past and offering me a position even while I was still living in Korea. I will continue to be appreciative as both he and my direct supervisor have wished me well in my endeavors, knowing that this was not my final destination.

One day, this organization will open its doors to a new breed of individuals, committed to the cause and armed with multi-disciplinary, holistic talent honed through a plethora of experiences. When that door opens, I hope to be one of the first to re-enter.

<a title="A Nice Gesture ｻ Serbian Salute by Marija ﾅerifovic" href="http://jeroenarendsen.nl/2007/05/serbian-salute-serifovic/">A Nice Gesture ｻ Serbian Salute by Marija Serifovic</a>

<blockquote>The three-finger salute is a Serbian salute with the thumb, index, and middle fingers open. The origin of this gesture is said to be the orthodox way of crossing yourself, with three fingers instead of the entire hand (referring to the Christian Trinity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit). That is not unlikely but the actual othodox crossing is done with three fingers together, not spread. The spreaded Serbian salute could however be seen as an exaggerated version of the hand used in crossing. It is as if the Serbs, in this gesture, stress their difference from people that cross themselves with the thumb touching the fingers in opposition (catholic Croats?).

The Serbian salute is made, for example, by fans and players to celebrate sport victories. Members of other ethnic groups, especially Bosniaks and Croats, are said to find it provocative. So, it is effectively a symbol of national and/or ethnic identity.</blockquote>

Wow; here I thought it was just a lazy peace sign. An interesting article on how this simple hand gesture is almost as offensive as a middle finger to some people groups--and the larger more philosophical topic of when a group identity can become detrimental.

There are two reasons why I joined Facebook besides the fact that I'll do anything to get away from <a href="http://www.myspace.com/its_leftsider">MySpace</a>. The first is that the two people who I communicated with the most on MySpace, my sister and my cousin, already made the migration. It was a matter of keeping in touch, getting responses in hours instead of days.

The second reason? Funny groups. Because Facebook originally was a college-only site, the networking aspect of the site quickly became  "what crazy notion can we band under?" Today, I'd like to introduce you to a few gems.

<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2211678511">UCF squirrels can beat up your school's squirrels</a>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2208523152">Petition to revoke the independence of the United States of America</a> 
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2209948167">I wish my homework was asexual so it would do itself.</a> 
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2225987026">1) Cut a hole in the box</a> 
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2209982805">Writing Papers Single Spaced First Makes My Double Spaced Result Climactic</a> 
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2215183344">If being a music major were easy, we'd call it Your Mom.</a> 
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2204989073">I See That You are Gangster. I am Pretty Gangster Myself.</a> 

There are quite a few others, but being sophomoric humor (literally) many are not fit for public announcement. Feel free to peruse and find the group that tickles your fancy!

For the last couple months I've been working under the radar with a team of people who are working on a new version of <a href="http://emilychang.com/go/ehub">eHub</a>, the <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/07/stop_calling_it_the_web.htm">internet2.0</a> app compendium founded by <a href="http://ideacodes.com">Emily Chang</a>. I submitted interest in participating on a lark, and I was very pleasantly surprised when Emily contacted me directly after I didn't pursue my inquiry. She's pulled a great team together and everyone's really excited about what eHub is and where it will go.

It was kind of hard to not mention it, but there were confidentiality issues initially, and, to be honest, I wanted to feel out the situation and settle on it before announcing. I did let my position drop when submitting my bio for <a href="http://gien.adventist.org">GIEN</a> as I didn't feel my credibility would have been as visible without it.

The most exciting part about the whole ordeal is that my writing was chosen as the first among the new editors to publish. It nearly broke my heart when it was posted to the front page with a faulty link that prevented people from reading its entirety, but <a href="http://www.emilychang.com/go/ehub/app/check-your-receipt-ehub-reviews-personal-finance-sites/">it is available now</a>. I enjoyed doing the piece and could easily see myself doing that for a portion of my living. :)

That's all, just wanted to put it all out there. If you have a category or specific app you think needs attention/review, let me know and I'll see if I can write about it.

BODY:
From the time we stepped foot in Korea, Fru and I worked hard to create a persona that did not fall easily into the English teacher stereotype. It was for good reason; I wasn't teaching but studying, and Fru was a graphic designer who had taken up a missionary assignment. Moreover, it was increasingly obvious that the perception of the foreign instructor was fading rapidly, so we had incentive to maintain our own appearance.

Why? Reports would have you believe that it was because these people, unemployed in their own countries, came over on forged degrees and spread drugs through the country and loose morals to the nation's youth--particularly females. Each of those trespasses evokes the image of a specific person or persons I knew, and for this reason we had <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2005/12/i_am_an_oddity_in.htm">little to do with expats in the teaching industry</a>.

While I admit the foreigner section could use a little cleaning up, it is downright appalling how they are presented by public media. News magazine shows uncover exposes, ferret out the worst of the worst and make them the general standard. Ratings soar, citizens are enraged, and we were cautious where we ventured for a window of time.

So when I saw the story of the <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2007/07/117_6614.html">Canadian teacher getting six months of prison time</a> for forging his degree, I didn't have much interest, let alone sympathy. Comments on the circuit of korean expat blogs that covered the story were much in the same line of thinking.

I feel dissonance now, however, in the discussion of <a href="http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=583&Itemid=34">Shin Jeong-ah</a>. A Korean who falsified documents confirming her Yale doctorate (which she apparently never even started) as well as her bachelor degree (which she did undertake but did not complete) and maintained this fraud for nearly a decade, Shin is being called the female version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Woo-Suk">Hwang Woo-suk</a>. Will she be treated the same as her Canadian counterpart in forgery? Or will she be left to lick her wounds and move on like Dr. Hwang?

It all boils down to appearance. South Korean media (why am I specifying? as if North Korea would give us a more favorable light!) will continue to prompt society's call for strict measures against foreigners to perpetuate the appearance of both the demonized foreigner and the Korean standard. Korean society will continue to let their fallen angels off in order to perpetuate the illusion of said standard.

The nail in the coffin is <a href="http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200707/200707190017.html">Lee Ji-young</a>, who proves that much of what Korea wants can be accomplished without the accreditation it requires. So why not give them lies and do a good job instead?
<blockquote>“When I was offered work as the host of ‘Good Morning Pops’, KBS asked me to submit a diploma. But my predecessor suddenly quit and I had to hurriedly take over the job,” Lee said. The producer of the show says he had no reason to doubt Lee’s academic qualifications, since she performed the job without problems for seven years.</blockquote>
If I could give one remedy to this seemingly perpetual problem, I'd suggest interviewing people based on their merit instead of on their paperwork's indication of their merit. Encourage an environment that rewards people for personal growth, not academic eliteness. If you have such a voracious appetite for language instruction and such a scourge of unqualified instructors, why not create a program that trains ALL foreigners to a certain standard for teaching; one that you can standardize and require. Indeed, if the program was good enough, people may start coming to Korea for the training itself.

I'd love to hear what others feel about this whole issue.

I heard about this a while ago and avoided it--who wants to see their phone placed in the ring with <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/01/iphone_observations_probably_p.htm">the most hyped mobile device</a> since the mobile phone itself?--but now that I look at it I'm really glad they did. The Ocean really is feature-packed, and I personally find it to be every bit as fascinating as the Apple offering.

I'm not an iPhone hater. I have <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/01/top_5_reasons_why_the_iphone_i.htm">more reasons not to get an iPhone</a> than I have reason to pony up the cash, but I recognize it as an exciting new device. Mobile providers have now been challenged to step up their game and support devices that really wow. Mobile device manufacturers now are digging through the R&D dust to unshelve the cool features and designs that were never going to reach the market. And a company that has nothing to do with an industry has turned it on its ear (in the same way it did with portable music--and music for that matter). These are all great things.

I think <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2007/07/links-for-200-8.html">Torrez said it right</a> when he said that the choice between the two is really about personal philosophy. I can support the importance by I can't personally justify the expense. For me, buying two Oceans makes about as much sense and costs roughly the same.

Yes Bryan, occasionally I do peruse your site…and have at last found reason to comment…you talking about “my precious” iPhone. *cue Gollum references*

Am glad you finally decided to look at the comparison, although on a slightly Helio friendly site. Ok…who am I kidding; it was on the Helio site. I guess getting your feet wet is a start, but since you are at water’s edge, take the plunge. And no, I don’t suggest you go to the equally hyped apple page to see their comparisons. Look instead at some nice third party reviews such as: 

http://www.iphonehacks.com/2007/05/iphone_vs_helio.html 

Fact is I came away knowing a bit more about your phone than previously, and am impressed with the 3gb support and GPS. Sweet. But even still, that’s not enough as there is only one phone to rule them all. THE iPhone. (P.S. talk to me in a few months when I can tell you about a few of the features I don’t like. It will give me some distance on that $599 I coughed up like a fur ball.)

<blockquote>A new report from market analysis firm JupiterResearch forecasts that the online population will increase from 1.1 billion users in 2006 to 1.5 billion users in 2011, representing about 22 percent of the world's overall population, or just over one in five individuals.</blockquote>

How will things change as more people are connected via internet? How does the internet change for you if saturation in western culture is already around 75%? At first glance, not a lot.

However, when you realize that other countries have considerable room for growth that they are currently taking advantage of (say, China, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2006/03/31/china-internet-usage-cx_nwp_0403china.html">who may have already more internet users than US despite less than 20% of the population having access</a>)? So many things to think about...

<blockquote>Fazlulla believes the handwritten pages are crucial to the paper and to the tradition of handwritten Urdu.

For centuries, handwriting was the definitive mark of social status, education and liberal values in India. Calligraphers mastered the swooping Urdu script in ivory-tower institutions and penned copies of the Koran for wealthy patrons. The pinnacle of a katib's achievement meant a seat at court and a chance to earn the sultan's ear.</blockquote>

When I talk about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Human-computer_interaction">human-computer interaction</a>, I'm not going down the general route that encompasses usability, intuitive user interfaces and task efficiency. These things are all important, but not the focus of my passion.

Instead, I am concerned about stories like this. Sure, a surface technology enabled table is nice, but what excites me is that perhaps it is one step closer to creating an interface that saves this time-honored tradition of calligraphy so steeped in culture and history. One must wonder, however, if technology will serve this purpose in time.

Can you really say that nothing is lost when a language may have its hand-written methods replaced by computer input only? This is <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/10/handwriting_the_lost_art.htm">not just a problem existing outside the US</a>. Can interaction design provide a way for us to avoid technology's current tendency to <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/05/now_that_the_semester_is.htm">erase existing culture</a>?

Ouch. This one hits close to home. My green and blue abomination of a site design can only be self-made, but the cameraphone pics to flickr and the twitter feeds (look to your left, if you're not RSSing) are pretty spot on.

For what it's worth, my sluggishness in posting is not because of a departure from real content, but an indication that leftsider is again changing. I've been working in a few areas that don't directly apply to Leftsider's theme; I thought of creating new blogs to talk about them, but instead I think that I'll be changing from the MovableType blogging platform to a full-on content management system, where I can post about everything and then divide it up via tag-enabled categories. I'm testing that now, which is why I haven't been as visible with new posts.

Let's bring internet 2001 back, shall we?

<blockquote>The plan will create three types of zones and provide tailored services for foreign residents by 2008.

Four business zones will offer improved environments for international businesses, six global villages will make residential life easier for foreigners and five culture exchange zones will offer enhanced attractions for visitors.

"The zones will be developed as areas where foreigners who cannot speak Korean can live and work without difficulty," a city official said.</blockquote>

Does anyone besides me find this a little unsettling? Were the toppling of the Berlin wall and the ending of apartheid in South Africa, which we consider progressive successes, moving in this direction or away? Will this improve day-to-day relations between Koreans and foreigners, or promote increased interaction to face social issues?

How strictly will these zones be demarcated? If I have a shop 10 meters outside the zone will I still need to provide foreigner-friendly service? If I move into an apartment one block outside the zone will my landlord have any obligation to translate documents for me?

I'll have to "call home" and see what my Korean friends think about this. I'm not sure I can call it a good idea.

<blockquote>It began a month ago. I was midway through "The World Is Flat," the bestseller by Tom Friedman. I like Friedman, despite his puzzling decision to wear a mustache. His book is all about how outsourcing to India and China is not just for tech support and carmakers but is poised to transform every industry in America, from law to banking to accounting. CEOs are chopping up projects and sending the lower-end tasks to strangers in cubicles ten time zones away. And it's only going to snowball; America has not yet begun to outsource.

I don't have a corporation; I don't even have an up-to-date business card. I'm a writer and editor working from home, usually in my boxer shorts or, if I'm feeling formal, my penguin-themed pajama bottoms. Then again, I think, why should Fortune 500 firms have all the fun? Why can't I join in on the biggest business trend of the new century? Why can't I outsource my low-end tasks? Why can't I outsource my life?</blockquote>

Absolutely fascinating. The depth to which this story goes borders on fiction; I'm not sure if I can really believe it at all! But what if it's true? Is it really acceptable to do this? My family in Central America have maids/helpers that help out periodically; is this the internet equivalent?

In fact, none of the 45,000 people who have sued Merck, contending that they or their loved ones suffered heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx, have received payments from the company. The lawsuits continue, for now in a state of legal limbo, with little prospect of resolution.

In combating the litigation, Merck has made an aggressive, and so far successful, bet that forcing plaintiffs to trial will reduce the number of Vioxx lawsuits and, ultimately, its liability.

Promising to contest every case, Merck has spent more than $1 billion over the last three years in legal fees. It has refused, at least publicly, to consider even the possibility of an overall settlement to resolve all the lawsuits at once.</blockquote>

Satan stole my writing instrument. 

It's the closest thing to a reasonable excuse I have for not writing. I told myself I'd do it later, or that the <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/07549468188388345490">topic I was currently ruminating</a> wasn't pertinent. A few times I actually sat down to write it and either lost my train of thought or became distracted. All part of an intricate plot  of the evil one.

As a result, I'm here creating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-story">backstory</a> when I should be telling you exactly what I'm thinking. 

There has been considerable conversation these days about storytelling--how rich and vibrant a vehicle it is, how much it shows culture, how <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/revivinganorexicwebwriting">sorely it is needed</a> in developing the web and technology in general, let alone cultural understanding outside of these areas. But there are more reasons, the greatest in my book being that not telling the story <a href="http://bjfogg.typepad.com/bj_foggs_weblog/2005/11/technology_kill.html">inhibits communication</a>. Your perspective is lost, and, simultaneously, others make assumptions to fill the space where your input could have created a more definite stance. 

All of this to say that the experience, and those related to it, suffer. As I am now completely about experiences, there is no excuse for this type of interactive handicap.

What is an experience?

It isn't a person, place or thing, nor is it related to time. It cannot be expanded, redone or erased. It can be recalled or forgotten, but even in its absence its effect is substantial. In fact, it is the source of our knowledge, so it is very impressive (in the <a href="http://ninjawords.com/impressive">accurate meaning</a> of the word).

Experiences are our responses and reaction to stimulus. It's what we think of a person, the way we feel about a place and how we associate things. In my opinion our life "time" should be spent focusing on the experiences we create rather than goals we set. We are never sure of what we can achieve, but we can definitely gain from every interaction.

Ideally, we want those interactions to be good. But how do we accomplish that? Is it possible to design an experience for maximum benefit? Can our perspective change our experience? The nature of culture, so varying in our species, would lead us to say yes. So why aren't we making better experiences?

The waiting room. The church service. The menu. Can there be improvement to the daily drivel that facilitates an improved life? I sure hope so. My new work as a consultant will focus directly on this (but more about that later), because I believe that in the same way that my personal relationships are enhanced by an understanding of my friends' experiences, business, religion, and community can also be improved. And I think that allowing these stories to flow will create a new level of information that could be, for the first time ever, truly mutually beneficial.

<blockquote>Actually the line that I think was the most telling but that she said like a throw-away qualifier was "I didn't know anyone in New York when I moved here...."

I think that is such a huge factor. To move to a city where you are not afraid to try something new because all the people that labeled who THEY think you are (parents, childhood friends) are not their to say " that's not you" or "you've changed". Well, maybe that person didn't change but finally became who they really are. I totally relate to this as a fellow Midwesterner even though my changes were not as quick or as dramatic.

I bet if you ask most people what keeps them from being who they really want to be (at least stylistically or maybe even more), the answer would not be money but the fear of peer pressure - fear of embarrassing themselves in front of a group of people that they might not actually even like anyway.
</blockquote>

I'm used to looking at the Sartorialist for the great photos... I don't know what I'll do if he starts putting out profound tidbits like this!

To be a balance, though, have you ever been to Oakbrook, Illinois, especially in winter? In the first picture her look is very Chicagoland. In the second pic her look is very New York--where she now lives. I agree with what he says but there is also much to be given to the tendency that living things possess to adapt to their surroundings. 

What do you think?

If you look to much, you're lecherous. If you don't look enough, you don't appreciate, and no matter what, your appetite will never be satisfied.

Taking the tidbits I've gathered from the last fourteen months of study, I thought it prudent to make everyday conclusions I could apply practically and explain elegantly to enchanted dinner guests. For  today's topic, I thought I'd cover something near and dear to my heart: Watching the girls in their summer dresses.

Now you see what happens when you give a simple person an education.

<a href="http://www.classicshorts.com/stories/dresses.html">Is it acceptable</a> for a man--particularly a married, committed man--to observe the beauty of the female form? In this question we specifically disassociate this activity with the pursuit of or fraternization with the object of attention; that's a much more involved topic that deserves a separate conversation. Instead, here we ponder only the benefit or detriment that is a result of this time-honored non-contact pastime.

Let's make an assumption right off the bat; men enjoy looking at feminine beauty. This assumption is important for a couple reasons. It tells us that:

<ul><li> men do not enjoy looking at feminine hideousness, and, therefore</li>
<li> men look because they find something beautiful.</li></ul>

Of course, this leads us to ask, "What is the <em>appeal</em> of the appealing woman?" I postulate that there are two subtypes of this appeal: the aesthetic and the practical.

In speaking of a woman's aesthetic appeal, it is important to note that this, <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/10/average_girls_are_hot.htm">under the scrutinizing eye</a>, often wilts, falls apart, or slinks away, as love and photons are also known to do. We simply must enjoy it for what it is. In the same way that I gasp at a big, beautiful sky or radiate with energy on a warm autumn evening, I am compelled to contemplate a woman by a specific emotional appeal. I think this emotion could be the same that people often ascribe to the creation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa">La Gioconda</a>: It is one which inspires and enchants--yes, enchantment is a perfect word to encapsulate this aesthetic appeal. The female beauty enchants me, the crisp autumn night invigorates me, and a grand, majestic sky humbles me.

Should man be humbled, invigorated, and enchanted? For the first two, I say yes, undoubtedly. There is a need for man to recognize his infinite smallness in relation to all space and matter, as well as a need for strength, courage, and diligence in order to persevere in the realization of this insignificance. The first two definitely have value in being.

Enchantment, however, is not so certain. That which is enchanting is charming; it is pleasant. Its nature attracts and delights us. As a result, here is as far as our universal definition can go. Many people actively seek pleasure as their sole reward in life and would deem this appeal as completely appropriate. Others would clearly separate earthly pleasures from those of a higher spiritual personal consciousness and may be divided as to the categorization of this pleasure. A hardy few eschew all pleasure, attraction and desire in the hope of attaining an enlightenment that is not distorted by limited human perception. For these, human enchantment would be a setback.

In short, the aesthetic appeal of a woman can be regarded as acceptable based on your preexisting life philosophy. If you do not have a life philosophy, <a href="http://zenhabits.net/2007/02/think-about-your-life-goals/">you probably should be thinking about that</a> instead of watching the view anyway, shouldn't you?

Now on to the second appeal, the one of a more practical nature. Instead of setting you to soar on a zephyr of euphoria, it leaves you firmly rooted to the ground, interested much more in action than concept. This is the reaction that many people are quick to describe as carnal, common, vulgar and base. 

Coincidentally, it is also necessary and vital to human existence. If men did not succumb to this practical appeal, it would be hard to imagine the mating process, and subsequent reproduction process, going very far. Just to clarify, we're not talking about <em>romance</em> here--which is possibly an invented concept that men don't really relate to anyway. This is an acceptance of an intrinsic tendency to perpetuate life (a fatal flaw in some philosophies), a taxonomic duty to procreate and, at is most trivial essence, the fulfillment of sexual release.

So why such a negative connotation? Because an excessive catering to these whims has been justifiably equated to a lack of control. See above; there are things of a higher priority than sowing oats.  There are those who place this at a higher value than is the social norm. As a result, most who find this attraction to be inappropriate do so because of this perceived licentiousness. In reality, the key to most sexual morality codes is not in right or wrong, but rather selective application. 

An idea that can apply to both aesthetic and practical attraction, but more can be more acutely utilized as a guide here, is the effect our observations may have on those being observed. A wife may complain of a husband's lustful eye but, in reality, very much appreciates that habit when it is directed towards her. Conversely, she may enjoy her husband's practical attraction but find that those of his best mate leave her somewhat uncomfortable. There are similar delineations with regard to age, environment, and other factors that can give insight into whether we're <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=1859">infringing on someone else's pursuit of happiness</a>.

Is there a switch that allows a man to turn this attraction on or off? Can man determine when it is prudent to activate it? And when it all boils down, what will become of that practical attraction? If you are keeping true to our scenario, maintaining this pastime as non-contact, It would seem that in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCFVbzitD7Q">almost every scenario</a> this would result in only repression and frustration. In this case, I don't believe these feelings are of any value to the common man.

Perhaps, then, it would be best if the individual man calculated for himself a control which would provide restraint and an exercise in control without binding these natural attractions so tight that they force themselves improperly through the seams or over the brim of our cool composure. Keeping in mind the fruits of his actions, he should seed to create a pleasant interaction for all. 

Ladies, have you thought of any formal approach to interaction with men?

BODY:
This morning I had a dream that is a parable of my current life decisions.

It was set in a basement restaurant somewhere; I sat at a small table just like the dozen other customers present at the time. The owner of the establishment was walking to each table chatting, observing and doing the owner thing, but he also was explaining to the patrons how to do something with the food at their table. It was almost as if it was a cooking class of some sort, just one where we all worked on different things.

Though I don't remember leaving the restaurant, I distinctly felt as if this tutelage was not a singular instance but, rather, a recurring theme. It was a class--one that spanned the course of a couple days. A few people joined mid-way and a couple others left without finishing. But the atmosphere stayed the same, and we slowly were learning.

At one point, we were asked to do something. I feel as if it were some type of group project or test, a proof of our understanding. We strained under the pressure of the task. No one knew how were were going to accomplish it, and our despair started to show. The owner, in his casual, passive way, questioned our planning and strategy. Sure the project was big, but aren't big things composed of small parts? See here: that decorative peeling you learned with the garnish she perfected, covered with the drizzle that the couple over there have been working on all this time... Aha! 

The lights came on in our heads and we completed our project successfully. It was a beautifully ornate thing; our instructor beamed with satisfaction, and we celebrated our accomplishment, pushing our little tables together into a makeshift dinner spread.

At this point, the owner disappeared; I felt as if he was, for our purposes, gone. As we waited for the celebratory food, my classmates talked about how he must have been a genius to teach us to make something so fantastic.

"He didn't give us a genius idea," the guy sitting across from me countered. "He just helped us see the genius ideas we each already had."

I agreed. I agreed with all my heart, and I knew that he understood the potential of humanity in a way similar to mine. Yet as he said it, our colleagues turned away from their success and looked back at themselves. Limited by their own self-perception and self-doubt, we could literally watch as they visibly sank from the elevated level they experienced back to the confused, despairing, leaderless creatures they were before the class.

I turned my head away; I think I wanted to cry, but I could not. I just knew I couldn't bear to look at them anymore, nor would I look at them and forget the new horizon I had just realized. The guy across from me noticed my actions and said something, but I was drifting out of slumber at this point and cannot remember what he said.

The dream encapsulated my feelings these days. In many ways, my move from a more default method of working and living to an independent (and, in my opinion, more traditional) style is the equivalent of me turning my head away in the dream. I refuse to accept the reality; I believe with all my heart only in the potential. If the only way to push toward that new horizon is to turn my back, even on those who have greater potential than I possess, so be it.

I do not live to be; I am here to live (writing that, I realize it sounds better when translated into just about every other language I can think of). I hope that today, and every day, I might be able to inspire one or two as the instructor did in my dream.

<blockquote>Biting on web 2.0 as the province of nothing but self-obsessed “white 20-something males” is… probably totally fair. In some senses. At least they’re (we’re?) the ones hyping it for the sake of it.

But for all their “I don’t buy CDs, I heart itunes music store” rhetoric I find most of this community are only barely “new media” in their day-to-day lives.

Coming back to some ideas I drew out in a recent presentation… its younger people, and often those in lower socio-economic communities that are really acting-out new media wise. Which is great. Because we hear so much about the “digital divide” and how the priveleged are the ones with the access to and knowledge about technology.</blockquote>

I like what he's saying here, for a couple of reasons.

First I think that it takes clarifications like this to see the real picture and, hopefully, devise a real solution. There are people who are already doing technologically savvy things with low tech; what happens when they manipulate the things which we now consider new or exciting?  It generally seems that in their hands technology takes a more practical bent. I'm thinking of the adoption of text messaging long before it caught on in more developed parts, as well as <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/blog/archives/2007/01/village_phone.html">Jan Chipchase's research on "Sente" in Uganda</a>.

If anything, I think that internet 2.0 is about unwalled gardens; an environment where people groups cultivate and create but where linking one group to another becomes easy and even expected for collective progress. People stepping up to the plate with the same tools as everyone else--and seeing what direction they'll run with it.

Which brings an important concept to the surface: should we be bringing them to speed or starting them out hard and fast? I think this is where the digital divide persists and perhaps thrives. <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/06/you_can_stop_adjusting_now.htm">Noting it a while back</a>, when will technology meet a culture where it is to develop without a primer, a starter course, a "first computer"--if we see potential, why not immerse them in the areas that need new thought rather than providing them well-traveled methods?

As noted in the link above, I think this is the only caveat--though a big one--I have with the OLPC concept. The digital divide will never disappear if we insist on hammering out deep roads to information. 

Would it have not been better if we asked every proposed area what they would need and design it for their own people and situation? If the OLPC looked completely different in every region because of local application? I'm <a href="http://www.architectureforhumanity.org/about/aboutus.php">channeling AfH here</a>, wondering what Cameron's take on the project would be.

 <a href="http://blogactionday.org"> <img src="http://blogactionday.org/images/action_468x60.jpg" alt="Bloggers Unite - Blog Action Day"> </a>

Today was <a href="http://blogactionday.org/">Blog Action Day</a>, the day where thousands of blogs around the world post about one particular theme. And on this day, the theme is the environment. But what can I say about the environment that you haven't already heard?

<strong>Be deliberate.</strong> Stop doing things because other people tell you. Stop worrying about the environment because thousands of bloggers are telling you to. Don't <em>you</em> care about the environment? For what reasons? If they are not strong enough to convince you, then nothing I or any other blogger will say can help you make long-lasting decisions in support of environmental preservation or restoration.

<strong>Be thorough.</strong> If you're going to champion a cause, do it. 2nd place is not a champion, and, even counting something other than Nobel Prize winner Al Gore as first, you are far from second. Do you think you've done enough because you understood <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>? If you are committed to protecting rainforests you will stop your paper statements, <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/09/14/pdf.html">print to PDF</a> unless necessary. If your thing is global warming, don't be surprised if I ask when you are selling your car, planning to <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/05/off_the_grid_mo_1.php">move off the grid</a> or <a href="http://www.walkscore.com/">what your walk score is</a>. If you don't like cruelty to animals but are not vegetarian... you see my point?

This world is in a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/trust/2015/index.shtml">very sad state</a>. We <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07EFDE1E3EF937A25750C0A9629C8B63">suffocate on our excesses</a> while the world crumbles and innocent, unfortunate and <a href="http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Poverty/death/">powerless people suffer</a>. YOU are to blame (I'm just as bad, as I'm writing this post on one of four computers in a two-bedroom, three-person apartment). Until we can face that reality, none of this will really change. 

I hope this will encourage you to think seriously about our environment and <a href="http://blogactionday.org/charities">what you can do to help</a>.

> It's not that I don't like Clinton--I do. Honestly, I think she's the most presidential person in the race, for either party. Some people say she's unelectable, but I don't believe that for a moment. And hopefully Kerry taught us the peril of nominating someone based on their supposed "electability."
> 
> But holy smokes, I am so sick of this dynasty crap. Bush? Then Clinton? Then Bush? Then Clinton? If Hillary wins she will likely be re-elected as well; when she leaves office, this nation will have been ruled exclusively by two families for 28 straight years--an entire generation! In 2020, no one under the age of 30 will remember a time when neither a Bush or Clinton was running the joint. And you know Jeb will be waiting in the wings. What's the point of having a democracy if we only use to to elect monarchs?

Hmm. Never thought of it that way. Maybe I'll need to use this strategy to dissuade Democrats this year (I used, "Wait for Hillary in '08" [during the '04 election season](http://archives.leftsider.com/2005/07/its-not-so-bad-when-you-rememb.htm)).

BODY:
Yesterday <a href="http://www.emilychang.com/go/ehub/app/ehub-analyzes-movable-type-4/">a piece I wrote about the new Movable Type 4</a> was posted on eHub. It was a story I asked for, but ultimately, I was unable to be as effective on the story as I'd like--mainly for very technical, mac-related reasons.

One of the things that really won me over when I was wrestling with switching in Korea was the relative ease with which you could create a development environment and test your sites and web applications locally on a Mac machine. I say relative because it did require some delving into concepts that I had been avoiding like the plague.

Now that I've got the new <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/763948996/">MacBook</a>, I really was hoping to avoid the hassle of setting up the development environment all over again. I was actually considering working with Ruby on Rails just so that I could develop in <a href="http://locomotive.raaum.org/">Locomotive</a>, but instead I found the answer to my dreams, <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp.html">MAMP</a>.

Usually your typical web dev setup consists of Linux, Apache, mysql, and PHP (or Perl). A short acronym is LAMP; MAMP simply refers to using the Macintosh platform (which runs on linux). A neat little app that allowed me to develop and test in such an easy way was all my dreams come true.

In the next day or so I installed about eight different content management systems, blogging platforms, wikis and other goodies. It worked without a hitch. With the added fun of <a href="http://www.leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/05/coda.htm">working with Coda</a>, life was a bowl of pitted cherries.

Enter MT4. This blog runs on MT3, so I was eager to give the new version a test drive. It's seemed natural that I just write about it as I go. I downloaded the beta and went to install. Installation is a lot easier in this iteration, though not as nice as some of the other systems I'd just installed. Dropping the static files into MAMP's htdocs folder and the cgi files into the cgi-bin, I opened a browser and worked through the install.

Progress halted at a request for the DBI module. Hmm. Oh wait; My <a href="http://zerokarmaleft.43people.com/">good buddy</a> showed me a little magic called CPAN... That should do the trick!

Well it would if I could actually MAKE the stupid module once installed. I can't, for the life of me, seem to get this module installed. It would seem a couple other people have had similar issues:

<a href="http://forum.mamp.info/viewtopic.php?t=1204&highlight=dbi">http://forum.mamp.info/viewtopic.php?t=1204&highlight=dbi</a>
<a href="http://forum.mamp.info/viewtopic.php?t=1131&highlight=dbi">http://forum.mamp.info/viewtopic.php?t=1131&highlight=dbi</a>

And that this may be an OS X issue:

<a href="http://www.cpanforum.com/posts/859">http://www.cpanforum.com/posts/859</a>
<a href="http://www.thescripts.com/forum/thread676055.html">http://www.thescripts.com/forum/thread676055.html</a>

But I can't seem to find a definite, consistent answer to correcting.

I'm tempted to just go the old way and install mysql, but thinking about that made me wonder where the location of MAMP's mysql is--would I lose the databases from my other web apps if I did that--and if Movable Type is looking in the correct location for the DBI module.

Unfortunately I'm not finding very many answers. And, of course, knowledgeable voices in this regard are in short supply. So, my return to blogging with regularity has been attacked again. I ended up installing MT4 and testing it from my webhost just to get the eHub piece out of the way. 

Since I want to upgrade this site and do some design diddling as well, this problem has been taking up huge portions of my day. I'll try to give posts some equal time. I'll also update this post for future generations if I ever do find an explainable solution.

Hmm, wish I could help with the Perl DBI install issue, but I really don't know where to start since I don't have hands-on access to a Mac anymore.  My guess (i.e. I'm totally talking out of my ass here) is that a typical CPAN module's install script is going to try and copy files to OSX's file hierarchy.  While MAMP, b/c it includes some duplicate software that exists already with OSX shipped, probably installs itself as a substrate.  A quick glace at MAMP's website didn't immediately confirm this, but Fink and DarwinPorts use this approach to avoid file collisions.  If so, the trick is to install the Perl DBI module into MAMP's file hierarchy.

At least you're thinking in the same direction. I gave a cursory glance over what's inside the MAMP folder. I'll give it a more thorough comb-over maybe this weekend.

Never went to the thing, but man did I have fun with the pictures. It really was where I went to think "fashion edge" before our trip to Korea. 

Actually, the real reason I even discovered the photos in the first place was because some site, long forgotten, linked to a series of the pics where a few people started going overboard with drunk guy jenga. Now that I think of it, was that <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/04/08/6222.html">from Kottke</a> as well?

<blockquote>This generation of teens has grown up on reality television, a genre that often thrives on conflict and humiliation ("American Idol" auditions, "America's Funniest Home Videos"). I think our culture as a whole has gotten much crueler -- the endless tabloid coverage, gossip blogs and celeb weeklies that pick apart stars, show close-ups of their cellulite and revel in their screw ups, has a trickle down affect on the young people that consume this entertainment. At the same time, we have managed to redefine what it means to be famous. You can endure a scandal or public humiliation and somehow come out on top, just like Paris Hilton, Miss Teen South Carolina...and who knows, maybe even Britney. Teens mirror this culture on a micro-level -- there's drama and mini-scandals happening online all the time. Compromising photos get posted and sent around leaving a permanent online record of teen exploits. Unfortunately, these teens don't have an army of publicists and media handlers to help them overcome the humiliation and transform it into fame and fortune. They are getting thicker skins though, and, I think, a growing sense of satisfaction in watching the celebrity trainwreck.</blockquote>

<blockquote>More than half of the world's 7,000 languages are expected to die out by the end of the century, often taking with them irreplaceable knowledge about the natural world, Harrison said.

"Most of what we know about species and ecosystems is not written down anywhere, it's only in people's heads," he said.

"We are seeing in front of our eyes the erosion of the human knowledge base." </blockquote>

... and now for something else totally out of nowhere! I think all the studying is frying the circuits in my brain. Anyway, how can you not smile listening to these girls chatter. Reminds me of the youth group back in Daegu.

Enjoy the sheer superficiality of it all!

He said that there were no homosexuals in Iran — not one — and that the Nazi slaughter of six million Jews should not be treated as fact, but theory, and therefore open to debate and more research.
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the president of Iran, aired those and other bewildering thoughts in a two-hour verbal contest at Columbia University yesterday, providing some ammunition to people who said there was no point in inviting him to speak. Yet his appearance also offered evidence of why he is widely admired in the developing world for his defiance toward Western, especially American, power.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The greater part of human history has gone something like this: see animal, chase animal, kill animal, skin animal, cook animal, eat animal. But all that chasing and killing and cooking means a lot of brutish work, and somewhere along the way we fell in love with the dream of the effort-free existence. Now iRobots vacuum our carpets and wash the kitchen floor; battery-operated, self-heating jackets from North Face and Maplin keep us warm; and our cars park themselves, if we're fortunate enough to own a Lexus LS 460.</blockquote>

You could say that you notice a trend in my recent posting. You could also notice that apparently I'm not the only one noticing this.

<blockquote>From seemingly out of nowhere there appeared no less than six gangsters who lined up behind my friend. Oblivious to their presence, my friend tightened his grip around the bbi kki's collar and continued his interrogation. "Oh shit," I thought, "this is going to get ugly." I walked up to within a couple of feet of the gangsters, preparing to do what little I could to help out my friend should they decide to jump him. </blockquote>

This story has been making its way through the Korean blog circuit; worth posting for the sheer surreality of this Korean reality. If you've lived there, you know it's true. :)

<blockquote>Korean businesses, which tend to be labor intensive and have low margins, will continue to need Hispanic immigrants to grow, said Dae Young Kim, a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland at College Park. He added that Korean business owners often feel that Hispanics "also have a sort of immigrant drive that would make them hard workers."

Thomas Yoon said that H Mart came to similar realizations. "We woke up and realized we couldn't run our stores without them. We had to start treating them for what they were -- important employees," Yoon said. </blockquote>

Sigh. So much to say there, so sad. Sometimes I wonder if even generational spans can traverse the space between Koreans and globalized reality. Sigh.

<blockquote>Over and over, today's culture not only reinforces that everyone is creative, but also that we have to be creative in order to be fully realized and fulfilled beings. We are told we need to have creative work, and that our creativity is the key to innovation at our work. This is true even as the number of cubicle-bound paper-pushing jobs ever seems to multiply, and as fewer and fewer jobs really require much creativity. We are told, and have bought the notion, that creativity is now the solution to every problem, and that without creativity we are destined for failure. And having bought into how essential is creativity, we end up constantly seeking validation--from the culture at large or from anyone who will give it--for what we want to hear: that we are creative, essential, important people who are valid and crucial to the working of modern civilization. </blockquote>

BODY:
I didn't write down my wedding vows. I knew that I could write something really eloquent, but I felt that polished words often outshine their true meaning. As I wanted to speak from the heart, I decided beforehand what things I wanted to say... and I simply said them as they came. It worked out well, happy ending.<br /><br />Today, a little over three years later, I don't remember anything I said. Once, in a rough season, my wife left her vows on the desk where I study. At the time I felt that was a very <a href="http://www.passiveaggressivenotes.com/">passive-aggressive way</a> of invoking a contractual obligation, yet I was remiss in not having a list of my own; a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/95_Theses">ninety-five theses</a> of marital guidance that I could nail to her closet or something. My words would be forever lost in the warm October afternoon where our lives were joined.<br /><br />I do remember one concept, however. It was a simple one (which may explain why it has stuck with me): If she gave me 110% and I gave her 110%, no matter what befell us, we'd have love to spare. Simple? Yes. Romantic? Undeniably. Mathematically possible? <a href="http://www.ncetm.org.uk/Default.aspx?page=17&amp;module=blog&amp;mode=100&amp;blogid=141">Let's not push it</a>; the concept was enough.<br /><br />And I intend to stick by it. A while back I noticed that my general unkempt-ness and deferring was placing an unnecessary burden on my wife, a patron saint of neatness (though I am the Archduke of organization). I tried to pitch in with household duties but my tolerance level of these menial tasks was so high that I literally missed the opportunities to act; her unswerving adherence to cleanliness swooped in and handled the tasks long before my alarm started ringing. <br /><br />But that was me giving a fair try; I was in it for the 110%. So starting around June or July I forced her to turn over all household duties to me. Cooking, cleaning, laundry, garbage--you name it, it was my responsibility. I explained to her the purpose of this initiative:<br /><ul><li>To give me a glimpse of all the work she does</li><li>To cultivate in me a lower threshold for messiness</li><li>To give her time to pursue goals and ambitions</li></ul>I patted myself on the back for coming up with such a novel idea. Surely any wife would shed a tear of joy for such a selfless, earnest gesture. In reality this process drove my sweetie up a wall; it took a while for my efforts to kick in, and the act of <i>leaving things</i> was painful as it went against the grain of her very being. Additionally, her eschewing of all things confrontational meant that any helpful nudges to prod me into action were basically given about 45 seconds before bludgeoning me to death with the cleaning instrument unused would start becoming a reasonable alternative.<br /><br />But I stuck it out. That's what 110% means, right?<br /><br />Today, after about 4 months, I'm ending the initiative. On a whole I think it was a failure, perhaps even my own little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward"><i>great leap forward</i></a>. Even in saying that, though, I know that I've become more aware of household duties and more keen to the energies my wife puts toward the appearance of our home. This morning, after she slipped out of bed, I could hear her moving the clean dishes from the dishwasher; to not do these tasks, I discovered make her feel less a part of her home. I would not have made the duty=ownership association had I not seen her inability to let go.<br /><br />Well, that was that. I anticipate that the general cleanliness of our house will go up again in a short while. My sister also moved in with us during that period, so we have extra hands to get the work done. Hopefully we three can still maintain a goal of 110% each to the excessive benefit of our house and home.<br />

<a title="Gym Jones - Power, Speed, Endurance, Suffering and Salvation" href="http://www.gymjones.com/">Gym Jones - Power, Speed, Endurance, Suffering and Salvation</a>

Think  your individuality is what makes you special, and that individuality determines how far you can go? Gym Jones--the gym apparently responsible for the meatfest in the movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG6FZZY9ciA">300</a>--says otherwise, snowflake:
<blockquote>
If you weren't given the gift you can't get the gift so the best you can do – if your goal is important – is work as hard as you possibly can, pay attention every hour of every day and then maybe, maybe if you've done enough and been smart enough you'll emerge from the muck of mediocrity to shine a bit brighter than you shone before. Then, upon reflection you might decide your goal is a bit more important so you'll start paying attention every minute of every hour of every day. You'll find people who are better than you and you'll take an empty cup when you meet them. Their example will destroy or inspire you and if it's the latter you may stay and learn. You might imitate, doing as they do because you've already accepted that you do not know best – if you did you'd be leading the group they were trying to join. Perhaps being exposed to their superior ability will drive you to work harder than you thought possible, or necessary. Maybe you'll overcome your self-imposed (or worse, society-imposed) limitations and shine even more brightly. Wow, you're getting it: positive reinforcement for hard work and suffering. So maybe you give your goal even more significance and you begin cutting away the ideas and the expectations and the people who you believe prevent you from achieving it. Now you become a real selfish prick, and you begin paying attention every second of every minute of every hour of every day, and you sustain your awareness for weeks and months at a time. You no longer think yourself a unique snowflake, you're a steel-edged blade shaped like a snowflake and you're spinning at warp speed. You're the biggest fish in the pond. You're a badass. Now you have options.</blockquote>

Interestingly, this physical fitness philosophy is surprisingly similar to aspects of Hindu principle. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, as India <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT8zcT7sbMk">has its own version of Gym Jones</a>, depending on your focus.

What would happen if everyone stopped focusing on differences, targeting instead the unattainable?

I'm a member of a semi-closed social network called [Asoboo](http://www.asoboo.com). It's mainly comprised of expats, creative professionals and foriegner-friendly citizens of Japan, with a few Japan-lovers around the world thrown in for sport. 

Recently, a guy new to Japan wrote a minor rant on Asoboo which he entitled "My Manifesto." The basic concept of his piece was that he was having trouble building relationships and dealing with stereotypes (he is a black male). It pricked a soft spot in me, having dealt with many of the same issues during my stay in Korea. So I wrote the following response, which probably could be considered my own reflective statement on living in Asia.
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
> Allow me to share some advice from one black man to another. Asia is going to be a lot of fun, but it's going to be like putting an ice cube in hot oil:
> 
> Point 1- you're coming is the merging of two different states (geographically, mentally, etc) and you are the odd one for now. Asian culture is built upon roles and positions, so if you're new you get--yes by default and it's bad--thrown in with everyone else. As you live and grow accustomed to the experience, though, you'll assimilate more and with greater success, just as the ice cube melts from the heat of the oil.
> 
> (But why did I use oil?)
> 
> Point 2 - You will never be Japanese, you will never be normal. You can become familiar in your neighborhood and circles. But even if you live there for ten years, learn perfect japanese and master the culture when you step outside your regular locations people will act as if you just got off the plane, speak impolitely about you in Japanese (thinking you wouldn't know), and assume you know nothing. Unless you become a star on tv everyday, there's nothing you can change about that.
> 
> Women will come. Bro, women will come--and it'll be a problem because you'll find girls who want to hang much faster than you'll find boys to kick it with, and that may cause tension with the few who do. nycboy is right that there are women who love black men. But that's who you are to them: black men. Not a black male, with an individual personality and ideas. Finding the female that recognizes that will be much harder, though not impossible. My finding is that a female like that more than often comes, surprisingly enough, from the group of people who'd normally avoid you because of stereotypes, but because she has a keen perception and a pure spirit she, over time, comes to appreciate you for who you are. More often than not, this relationship will be painful as no one else around you will have the same perception. Her family may war against you causing hell; they may win, causing heartbreak.
> 
> But this is Asia. This is what we signed up for when we came. And, more importantly, our every action, every won battle, every conquered stereotype shows who black men really are. It makes it easy for the next brother coming over; he won't have to deal with that foolishness. You are a pioneer in that regard, a beacon of light for your people.
> 
> And, should you accept that role as I think you already have, you'll find that when you return home you'll never find another way to be more of an impression on the world. You'll miss the days when the girl's eyes light up as she realizes you are more than an MTV projection. You'll long for the days, when your boy, drunk as hell, puts his arm around you and wordlessly conveys how you are brothers despite the color, despite the language, despite the imperfection of the world.
> 
> Hang in there. You'll achieve what it is you're there for. Check out some tips we wrote here for living abroad. And feel free to ask any question you might have from those of us who share(d) your experience.

I've been using MT for over five years, so this is nothing unusual. I've spent over a week trying to determine why this site wont rebuild properly, but I've yet to solve the issue. If you see some problems, definitely let me know.<br /><br />I switched to a <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">feedburner</a> feed some time ago, so those of you reading from the feeds should not have to update your feed URL. You may, however, get a couple repeat posts and such, as I've wiped out and reinstalled the site nearly twenty times in the last 6 days. At very least, I can be happy that my line breaks should now appear in the feed.<br /><br />Finally, the style of Leftsider will change slightly. I'll be using excerpts in the feeds, and extended entries may become more common on the front page. I'll also be writing more intimately and introspectively here than I have most recently; all my other writing will go to a few other blogs, which I'll be naming shortly.<br />

I've been so accustomed to doing things independently that I've become unaccustomed to even the most basic family norms.<br /><br />I made a resolution to improve my family relations. <br /><br />To be clear, there's no bad blood in my family. It's just that I live apart from the bulk of them, geographically and philosophically, and subsequently only show up for events and gatherings. I'm not a part of their routine, nor are they of mine; that infrequency makes it difficult to have anything but a superficial connection. <br /><br />I reflected on my younger days recently and remembered how much time I spent outdoors. I lived in the country, I camped in the woods and ran through the fields. I wished for a chance to do that again. It's harder to do these days as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/sets/58171/">the place I called home was no longer such</a>. Going to my mother's house was quiet and peaceful, but decidedly less removed. <br /><br />I decided I wanted to go camping again. Like the old days; primitive, like when I was a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/corovictoria/454641578/in/set-72157600063241026/">Pathfinder</a>. I remembered that I had bought a 3-man tent not too long ago. Was it time for me to have my <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%201:9-13;&amp;version=50;">40 days in the wilderness</a>? My solitude in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hira">Mount Hira</a>? I hope not; I emailed my dad to see if my tent was still at his house, and then I invited him to join me. <br /><br />It's been years since my father and I did anything together, just the two of us. To be honest, it wasn't much of a common thing when I was little, but the things we did do together I cherished. I was wary of how we'd mesh decades later, but was committed to my ideal. If I claim that family is important to me, I should work to maintain it.<br /><br />He immediately shot back a reply agreeing; I know I've always been the primary cause for my distance from my family, so this didn't surprise. But when it came down to nailing down a time and location, he became a little elusive. He started noting that weekends were so full, the quickly changing weather (though he noted he preferred cold weather camping to summer's heat), and even the fear that he had become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_materialism">too acclimated to life's accoutrements</a> to enjoy "roughing it" as he once had. As the time passed, the prospect of this happening became more and more suspect.<br /><br />Finally, I selected a site and date. He shot back another quick reply: "Looks Nice." This weekend when Fru mentioned the event, he lamented the timing as <a href="http://www.fool.com/personal-finance/general/2007/11/05/6-steps-to-salvaging-holiday-finances.aspx">the holidays tend to put a pinch on resources</a>. All of a sudden, I feel like a kid pestering his busy father for something which he will ultimately gain nothing from but the joy of pleasing his son. Perhaps the mutuality of benefit was never there to start with.<br /><br />In thinking about other relationships I have, I find it difficult to find one where the gain is evenly distributed. Perhaps as humans we are unable to have relationship homeostasis. We are constantly in need of giving and taking from those around us; it is a currency that keeps the economy alive. Perhaps this is close to the Buddha Gautama's basis in the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratitya-samutpada">dependent origination</a>. It could be said that this is family activity on a universal level.<br /><br />At any rate, reconnecting with my family has been more difficult than my <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/rls/22520.htm">roadmap</a> would have me believe. I still think I'm on the right track, however. We invited my sibling Kim to come live with us when she graduated this summer, and that has helped our interaction tremendously. Fru also is relating to Kim as an individual rather than as my sister, and they've become friends (thankfully). This has helped form a new nucleus of family; the center of activity has shifted in our direction. Let's see how I'll fare closer to the eye of the storm.<br /></div>

BODY:
Last week I talked with a friend about homeless fashion. After recalling a guy who was always seen in a well-fit (though worn) suit, we pondered why the homeless never really seemed to subscribe to general fashion norms. <br /><br />It is obvious that a person who lives without permanent shelter must dress more for utility than for show. Their clothes will work much harder and be treated much less than the clothes of the average suburban closet. As a result of their constant usage they'll look dingy, yes; it is not to these fashion rules of crispness or fancy that we are referring. We were thinking more that fashions change rapidly and vary by location and social strata. We are not experts on homeless societies, but there seems to be much less variation. Moreover, what is worn often seems to be unappealing to <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2005/02/23/1309441.htm">anyone who had a choice</a>.<br /><br />It was my assertion, therefore, that the clothes of the homeless were the selections from a body of clothing which was generated under the assumption that "beggars can't be choosers." She immediately noted that the average thrift store is filled with items that are absolutely horrendous, wondering why anyone would think a homeless person would want to wear that. I reminded her that any clothing that was given secondhand was once the first-hand wardrobe of someone; we can only blame ourselves for the bad taste in outfits sported by our homeless contemporaries.<br /><br />
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
If I took a homeless person shopping for a first-hand wardrobe they
could utilize for this wintry season, what would they buy? Would it
combine utility with societal acceptance, or would it continue to be
pragmatic to such extreme levels? Could the homeless community
participate in fashion as equals instead of recipients of the remainder?<br /><br />It is this same concept that keeps me from being excited about the OLPC project. <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2007/10/eliminating-digital-divides.htm">I've talked about this before</a>,
but I don't really hear anyone else talking about it. What I hear is
how great it is to give poor people a computer that can give them
access to what the rest of us have. The laptop is durable, portable,
and has decent features for its price. Let's give it to the world;
there's <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/NussbaumOnDesign/archives/2007/12/is_one_laptap_p.html">no way they could complain about a free computer</a>, right?<br /><br />If
I took one of my contemporaries from the developing world shopping for
a custom-built machine, what would they buy? Would it look anything
like the XO? More importantly, could the developing community
participate in the development of technology or continue to be the
recipients of the remainder?<br /><br />Conversely, if I found a vault of
unclaimed cash of such proportions that I could provide an XO to every
person of every developing nation, what would I have accomplished?
Uniformity, for the most part. Is that really what we want--for
everyone to solve the issues of technology from the same perspective
that we approach them from? Granted, we may see <a href="http://contentgreenhouse.com/blog/2007/12/desirelines.html">desire lines</a>
that indicate more efficient ways, but these are reactions to
implementations that are not accommodating user intentions; do we
really want our technological discoveries to be achieved through such
happenstance? <br /><br />I hope that the plight of both the homeless and
the developing society might be better approached. We only do ourselves
a disservice by not seeing these communities as equals who can aid us
as much as we aid them.

	Fru and I went to sunny California for the holidays, leaving on Christmas eve and returning just this past Friday. <br />
<br />
Normally, when we take long trips, I update with a barrage of photos. I'm still considering whether to do that or not. If not, I may just write a longer and more descriptive recap of the events. At any rate, stay tuned.

	The most impressive thing about the Cali trip was actually the reason why we came. Spending time with family has always been a thing I've enjoyed, though some might say that is in theory rather than practice. I haven't, however, spent this much time with family and family friends with such a negligible amount of irritation. It was a good thing, as we were swamped with people from the moment we stepped in the door (this pic is about an hour or two after reaching the house).<br />
<br />
Though the faces changed, we were very rarely without an entourage to guide us or partake in our discovery of the area. Coming from a small family, I was overwhelmed and grateful for the warm California welcome. And did I mention food?

	We were fortunate to find San Francisco in exceptionally bright and clear weather as we made our way out of our food-filled abode and started to explore. Being my first trip to the west coast, I was particularly interested in the terrain, which proved itself to be quite diverse. <br />
<br />
In addition to remote locations (like here at the back of the bay) we also hit the usual locations like the Golden Gate Bridge, SF MOMA, Embarcadero, the Japanese Tea  Garden, and Chinatown, among other sights. This took up about two days.

	After a day with friends in Oakland, Fru and I headed down to Southern California. <br />
<br />
Originally, the plan was to take the senic Pacific Coast Highway down and enjoy the view. But since we anticipated a good bit of congestion on a sunny Sunday drive (and not impervious to the fact that we can never seem to make a departure time when on holiday), we decided to take the "direct route" of driving the 5 down to LA. <br />
<br />
As I've never been to a desert or seen hills so friggin' big, this was just as scenic as anything I had expected. Amazing drive; one to preface the PCH trip on the way back up.

Before watching the ball drop with the cousins, we drove out to Redlands/Loma Linda and hooked up with some of my old schooltime buddies. I knew three were there, but it seems California has a weird magnetic attraction. :)<br />
<br />
These guys chimed in with Fru's relatives: "You guys need to move over here!" I'm starting to be swayed...

	Even though the cousins had enough plans to last us another week, we decided to head back north on the 2nd. We took the super-scenic Pacific Coastal Highway north until the sun set.<br />
<br />
That's about it for major parts of the trip. We ate lunch with Max and Emily of Ideacodes on Thursday, but I forgot to take a picture. Rains came that afternoon, so we stayed indoors until the flight home. <br />
<br />
Cali has a great feel about it, one that is more than just pleasant weather and progressiveness. I can't put my finger on it, so I guess I'll have to visit again!

We don't appreciate things that are free.<br /><br />We appreciate things we have to work for, things that are expensive; we appreciate things that are of limited quantity or for a limited time. Be certain, though, that if we find something that is free, we automatically assume that there is something inferior about it--something that makes it not worth the value of a purchase.<br /><br />Free advice. Free sample. Free time, even. Why else would they give it to us? What are they planning next? What will this free thing encourage me to buy or force me to support out of guilt? There's nothing free in this world; everything exists due to some expense of energy.<br /><br />So it should come as no surprise that our house and its accouterments, which we offered to my sister (mentioned <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2007/11/house-and-home.htm">earlier)</a>, have come under such neglect and disregard. It was, of course, free: assigning to it all of the aforementioned catches and stipulations. There would be no reason for her to assign a value to it unless it was one given in guilt or upon conversion. And she'd be right; there always is some cost attached.<br />
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
The expense that compensates for her free place is paid by my wife and I. Not really in money, for we had the apartment before she moved in, but in family preservation. We thought it important to support family, and hoped to include her in a more intimate family circle. Perhaps, in retrospect, it was a free trial offer--hoping that she'd buy in to something greater and of higher value.<br /><br />But she didn't. And it only goes to show that perhaps we put all our hopes into something that wasn't really a vialble alternative. Perhaps we didn't stimulate and encourage involvement and ownership. We probably didn't foster interaction in an effort to avoid smothering. Plainly put, we failed to effectively plan--and we all know what that effectively is.<br /><br />Lesson learned. And, probably, a lesson not quickly forgotten. We paid for it, after all.

I am a one-man army, hell-bent on bringing equality to the world.

In a sense, I am establishing a line of demarcation between choice and consensus.<br /><br />You'd be surprised how much you do each day that is done by default, never even considering the options. You'd be even more depressed if you realized how many times you did things just because they were easier or more acceptable rather than because they were <i>what you wanted</i>. <br /><br />Often this little campaign I'm on finds me doing things I don't want to do, but it's better to choose to sacrifice than to sacrifice for no reason at all. It's necessary for some crazy individuals like me to be the moderators that make this kind of utopia possible. <br /><br />So if you're obsessive about equality, and compelled to act, you can start small and grow. I'm sure there are items in your refrigerator that are in odd-numbered quantities. :)<br />

For the entirety of my life, I have been a church-goer. That doesn't mean, however, that I'm a church-liker.<br /><br />As I get older, I like going to church less and less. At first I did it because it was where my parents drove me, then I wanted to go and be with friends. Eventually I became aware of a personal relationship with "God" and looked forward to participating in the activities of His house. These days I go out of duty more than anything else.<br /><br />In the eleven years since I graduated from high school (and never graduated from college, arg), I've spent five working at the world headquarters of my denomination. Truly an enlightening and eye-opening experience, I've been around the world with the fortune of seeing worship done in so many styles. I've seen what it takes to run an organization (read: that's all a church really is) and I've developed an opinion on what should and shouldn't be.<br /><br />All the while I've been going to my little church and supporting as they do things backwards. Tradition dictates it, after all. This morning, as I passively skipped attendance (a rarity, let me assure you), I asked myself what it would make a church the kind of place that I'd enjoy attending again. Here are the conditions I came to.<br />
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<ul><li><b>A refreshed take on the concept of community.</b> We have an abundance of examples of how today's individual handles community and interaction. Churches see little--if any--of these new trends. Give up the pomp and circumstance and focus on the user experience--and what they're actually supposed to be experiencing.</li><li><b>No more random sermons.</b> The message for the service should not be at the speaker's whim. Keep it coherent! Set a chronological order (hmm; the beginning-to-end of the holy scripture of denominational choice sounds like a good start) and work with it to completion and audience comprehension; then go on to the next logical progression. Take a path and follow it to its end. </li><li><b>Follow a Rabbi.</b> Emphasis is given to find someone further along in their spiritual journey to whom you can communicate, providing you mentorship. Ask questions and get practical answers instead of sitting in a pew regurgitating arbitrary cliches.</li><li><b>Network with other disciples.</b> A 1:1 ratio is near impossible, so it would behoove a participant to glean from other students of the same mentor. This would alleviate burden upon the mentor as well as foster giving as well as taking among his advisees. Discussion groups and informal classes&nbsp; could sprout from here in a way that Sunday/Sabbath schools could if better emphasized.</li><li><b>Cut the entertainment.</b> It's not a show; it's a way to improve your life. This is why no one with a critical mind takes church seriously. Music and drama and ambiance; is it a church or a theater? Dedicate yourself to your beliefs.</li></ul><br />Naturally, these changes would completely change the way church works. Still, I don't see them as being threatening to any core value of any major religion. A lot of non-western religions follow these concepts to greater implementation in society. If I could find one that suited my taste, maybe I could enjoy attending church again.<br />

Who isn't fascinated by Chinese characters? A single graphic that encapsulates an entire word, concept or idea; it brushes upon essence of linguistic efficiency--deterred only by the fact that there are so many words, concepts and ideas to be represented.<br /><br />Some manifest their fascination by a permanent inking (which I <a href="http://www.zug.com/pranks/chinese-tattoo/">do not advise</a>). Others follow the stroke and order to inspiration through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_calligraphy">calligraphy</a>. For me it is enough to simply use them; being able to communicate with an audience so vast is awe-inspiring. With the assistance of modern technology I can use the learning of a language to speak with the world. <br /><br />So in addition to my mother's tongue, Spanish, my first truly foreign language, Korean, and my dabblings in Japanese, I've started taking a class in Chinese. We've received Chinese names this week, and I asked my professor If I could use the same Chinese characters I used when making my Korean name (In Korean, Chinese characters are called "hanja"). <br /><br />My Korean name is 이강진, Kang-jin Lee. To show her my name, I looked up my name again in my <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=psO_Oli22m8C&amp;dq=handbook+of+korean+vocabulary&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=YKfbxLesS3&amp;sig=RMRPx6NBKIFc_WaZXn3qHKTJZqs&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search?q=handbook+of+korean+vocabulary&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=title&amp;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail">Korean vocab book</a>. I found the characters easily, but I didn't know how to write Chinese on my mac. Once I did, I realized I didn't know the Chinese pronunciation of these characters, so I still couldn't type them. What I needed was was a <a href="http://kldp.net/projects/hanja/">Hangul(Korean) to Hanja conversion</a>--or a way to select hanja while typing Korean. After a little searching, turns out <a href="http://www.foolsworkshop.com/120a/koreanmac.html#hanja">you can already do that on a Mac</a>. Who knew?<br /><br />So now I can type to you using Chinese, Korean and two of Japanese's three character systems (the third basically being Chinese)--in addition to the alphabetical systems. Hopefully someone will find this article an easy reference for typing in Chinese on their Mac. Oh, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Entering_toned_pinyin_with_Mac_OS_X">how to type in Pinyin on a Mac</a> as well.<br />

The five classes that I'm taking this semester are quite different from <a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/08/why-im-leaving-my-job.html">last semester's five</a>. Instead of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/1459663938/">books piled high</a> with critical thinking, philosophy and religions, I'm taking two art classes, two design courses, and first-level Chinese.<br /><br />I braced for the worst with Chinese, known as (arguably) the most difficult language to learn. To my surprise, the courses that have brought me the most stress sofar have been the art classes. I knew I wasn't an artist, but these classes have been pounding me into a different frame of mind.<br /><br />My illustration instructor has waxed poetically on the virtues of the stroke, the basis of all art and illustration. For me, it was like not seeing the forest for all the trees. Which was, in fact, the point that he was trying to get across: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images"><i>Ceci n'est pas une pipe</i></a>, or, for the younger set, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXKFTzlBziI&amp;feature=related"><i>There is no spoon</i></a>. All that art is, indeed, is just a bunch of marks. Good art, therefore, requires great marks (or gestures).<br /><br />This goes back to <a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/10/how-creativity-is-killing-the.html">an assertion I posted about earlier: Artistry is not innate</a>; it is not a natural thing that you are either born with or with out. It is the culmination of tireless training, practice and perfection of form.<br />
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
I've been wrestling with this concept rather than just let it pass. How many manifestations of this theory can we see in the world? Today as I was resting my hand from the arduous stroke-making, I imagined <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt-gv6uN-x0&amp;feature=related">guys in training somewhere</a>, uniformly spaced out and practicing some martial routine over and over and over again. They do it until they know it, and then until it is unconscious, and then, still, until it exists in everything. That is when they are masters.<br /><br />I've been watching an animation called History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi, the story of an ordinary wimpy guy who undergoes training under five masters of varying arts. About halfway through the series he starts applying himself at a higher level, announcing that he would "practice until the [training room] floor breaks." Later he takes it another step, asserting that practice must be continued until the will of the disciple is broken. From a western standpoint, this may sound like taking a perfectly unique individual and turning them into a machine; a machine, however, has an superhuman level of accuracy and precision that man aspires to.<br /><br />Perhaps I, too, need to intensify my training. Perhaps I will be broken by the smallest of gestures, the stroke, and from that become the work of art I aspire to be.<br /><br />This is why I love school.<br />

I've been thinking a lot about preference recently. What, precisely, is it? Is it an inextricably interwoven feature of our human makeup? I ask because I think humanity would be a lot better off if we could disconnect from it. <br /><br />Once we deliberately drop our personal preferences our second method for decision making is common good. "I don't care either way, so what works for everyone?" Perhaps you've heard this when planning an event or going out for lunch with colleagues. Currently, to perpetually place common good first would bring a level of altruism that would be nothing but oppressive. But what would happen if our preferences never existed to begin?<br /><br />Permit me to give some simplistic examples that might help conceptualize this potential reality. Traffic flows with a simple, efficient order. Queues are drastically reduced. Provisions are made available for all.<br /><br />There are, however, significant issues I'm wrestling with that need to be solved:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Can our values be retained if our preferences are removed? Flavor is important for culture.<br /></li>
<li>When do preferences stop and duties/obligations begin? We can't have a society of unemployed, detached nomads wandering around.</li>
<li>How close is this to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanyasi#Etymology">Hindu renunciation</a> of the world or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratitya-samutpada">Buddhist interdependent arising</a>? Or even Christianity's "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethic_of_reciprocity#Christianity">Love your neighbor as yourself</a>"?</li></ul></blockquote>Perhaps it's time to dust off the long dormant <a href="http://wiki.leftsider.com/">Leftsider wiki</a> and really flesh things through.<br />

	So yeah it was a typical week; work and family and oh yeah I drove 2700 miles across the country with my German pal, Enno. Guess it wasn't a typical week after all.<br />
<br />
We left Friday afternoon, heading to Berrien Springs, Michigan, where his brother was hosting his parents and visiting grandparents from Holland. We spent Saturday with them, and took off early Sunday morning, driving through Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska, reaching Colorado just as a snowstorm decided to do its business.<br />
<br />
After a nice night in Denver, we drove over those gorgeous colorado mountains, across the state, through Utah and Nevada (with a mandatory stop in Sin City), reaching California just after midnight.<br />
<br />
Tuesday was mostly spent recovering from our three-day blitz. We also met up with <a href="http://staires.org/"> Brad</a> and <a href="http://veritas.staires.org/">Mike</a> (@brad and @obsy on <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter</a>) for a good bit of humorous conversation before I was whisked off to the airport for a red-eye flight to Boston and a connecting flight home.<br />
<br />
People say I was crazy to make such a trip, but I think that may have been the best thing to happen in 2008 so far. I sometimes have to remind myself that the level of excitement in my life is totally dependent upon me. And the experiences I gained really add up (more on that later).

Every morning when I drop Fru off at work, she turns and gives me a kiss. I'm not sure if this is usual fare for the married set, but it's pretty routine for her. If it were up to her, every time that she left me for any length of time she'd signify it with a kiss. <br /><br />This, to me, is the absolute worst.<br /><br />My feeling is that a kiss is not a greeting, or a farewell, or a
tradition. It is simply a sign of affection. Affection does not show at
the same time each day or with unerring recur. Affection happens at
unique moments of the day when something inside you is gladdened by
their presence; when you thank them for that feeling with a kiss, it
may almost seem spontaneous.<br /><br />At night when I go to bed, I plant
a kiss on Fru's arm. Then I think about her, and I do it again. I
repeat this process until I'm able to give her a kiss that is a total
act of appreciation; a sincere token of my affection. <br /><br />That's
what a kiss should be to me. It's hard to explain, however, to someone
who thinks otherwise. How can you tell someone to only kiss you without
pretense and as randomly as possible?<br /><br />But think about your
favorite kiss... what can you remember about it? Do you remember it
happening? Chances are it was either something that came out of the
blue, or one that was meant to happen as the two of you were full of
affection for each other. It was not attached to an event or time, most
likely, though there may be some exceptions like a wedding day or New
Year's Eve. Even in these exceptions, though, the time or event took a
second place to the intensity of the moment.<br /><br />If people gave kisses their appropriate value, I think we could all enjoy them a little more.<br /><br /> <br />

Last week my young and reckless classmate Amy gave me a good grilling. "Your wife is Filipina? How did you meet?" she asked. "Was she a mail-order bride? Did you actually know her before you bought her?" This is typical of the conversation that we have leaving class.<br /><br />"You have an Asian fetish, don't you?" she continued, without pause. I laughed, countering her assertion with the fact that she, being Chinese-American with a white boyfriend, either was an unwitting victim or actually encouraging the stereotyping. Maybe she had a "white fetish" that merited discussion. As you can guess, the remainder of the discussion didn't really hit any breakthroughs.<br /><br />But the issue of an Asian fetish is one that hits close to home, for a unique reason. I've never felt the branding applied to me; from the time I met Fru until now, I'd say that my preference for females was most occupied by latin and mediterranean attributes. But recently I've discussed with Fru the worry that I'm becoming prejudiced against Asian-Americans, both male and female.<br /><br />"Great," she says. "Now you're gonna hate me too."<br /><br />
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
Never that, dear. :) Seriously, though, I'm telling you that I struggle with
Asian-American existence, particularly regarding language and
tradition. Being a person that had few friends outside of black and
white growing up, minorities of other heritages fascinated me when I
reached high school. I knew nothing of my mother's family in Costa Rica
until I was in my twenties, so Spanish-speaking friends made me
feel ashamed of the disconnect between me and my history. In my eyes,
that was something they could be proud of; something that made them
citizens of two cultures, really. I was envious.<br />
<br />
In high school I had a couple Korean friends. Years later, when someone
voiced a need for a Korean study partner, I took up Korean on a lark. I
guess I thought it'd be funny if I saw those guys in a reunion and
could converse in Korean. Nothing more than that; I should've been
improving my Spanish instead. But when I started to apply myself to
Korean language study, I found that it revealed an additional layer of
perception to the mindset and thinking of the people who speak it
natively (this is true of almost all languages: if you lose the
phrasebook and learn the literal translation of words you'll discover a
depth easily overlooked). I became interested in Korean as a way to
understand Koreans. I think this is where I went wrong.<br />
<br />You see, I never knew Koreans--I knew <i>Korean-Americans</i>. Going over to
Korea to study only worsened the issue: I ate, drank, laughed and cried
with Koreans until I felt I knew the mind and method of the average Cho
(look, I made a language funny!). I visited Singapore and Japan,
finding subtle differences but also the same (mostly Confucian)
principles. I had found the inroad to Asian culture, and I was intent
on utilizing it for maximum efficiency.<br />
<br />
Imagine my surprise when I came back to the US and found myself
surrounded by Koreans who didn't act that way and primarily spoke English. And some of them
didn't know Korean at all! Inwardly, I curled my lips in disgust at the
thought of the heritage-less people I encountered. If I saw two Asians
and only one had an accent, I automatically gravitated toward the one
"fresher off the boat." Yes, in the same way that Koreans in Korea do
to Korean-Americans. I had unknowingly adopted their prejudices perfectly. <br />
<br />
I found myself awkward around Asian-Americans. I didn't want to talk
about American things; I wanted to talk about the Asian things I knew.
In the same way that my Asian-Am friends were never seen as Americans
in Korea, I couldn't see a face of Asian definition and think American.
Going to California over the holidays was a huge shock, as there were
several places I visited where my default black/white/hispanic
community was unknown and asian/white/hispanic was prevalent. Racial
issues I thought of as norms were completely blown away, and for the
first time I had to face the truth...<br />
<br /><blockquote><b>
Fetish:</b> <i>noun</i>.&nbsp; A course of action to which one has an excessive and irrational commitment.<br /></blockquote>
I have an Asian fetish. I prefer Asians over Asian-Americans in a
prejudiced manner. Ironically, I still know little about
Asian-Americans, so I rely on stereotypes that are fostered by
ignorance and nationalist bigotry. As hard as it is for me to write,
and as hard as it may be for you to believe, I have yet to recall a
person of Asian descent that I've viewed solely as American.<br />
<br />
I hope that, after reading this, all my Asian-Am friends don't react
with bitterness and resentment. In fact, I need them now more than ever
before--now, you see, I've decided to learn more about Asian-Americans,
see these Americans for who they are, and recognize their essentialness to this
American community.Perhaps through this I will come to a better understanding of my existence as a partially hispanic black American as well; I feel more American than anything else, and that's not much.<br />
<br />We all have prejudices and fetishes that we carry. If we are perceptive
enough to recognize them and strong enough to objectively prove them,
we can improve ourselves and the world around us. <br /><br />

BODY:
About a month ago, I stopped at a bakery, grabbing a pastry before heading off to meet a client. As I turned out of the parking lot and onto the street, I saw a man standing on the median with a sign and a cup. While not uncommon, what struck me was his attire: khakis, worn loafers, and an earth-toned pullover. Considering <a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/12/give-an-olpc-laptop-to-an-infe.htm">previous discussions I've entertained</a> regarding their clothing choices, I was taken aback; this pan-handler's outfit was (dangerously?) close to my wardrobe. <br /><br />"Wow, this neighborhood is more affluent than I thought," I sneered. "I'm at the same level as the bums."<br /><br />Today, if I stood up and walked to the front window of my new apartment, I can see that very median. What has changed for me? Not a thing. I've not become any more affluent. I'm imagining that perhaps my brother on the street is in much the same situation as well. Now, however, we walk in much closer circles, and the disparity between us is amplified.<br /><br />I'd like to think that my affinity with him was more than just clothing options. But how often do we consider each other based on how we are dressed? Don't be caught in last season's offerings. In this new neighborhood, Mercedes are the new Honda; try a Maybach, Bentley or Lambo if you want to set yourself apart. All the houses are big--even the small ones. I live here, but never have I felt more out of step.<br /><br />This environment has exacerbated my recent contemplations on status. Never before have I been more inclined to reject the concept of status altogether.<br />
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<blockquote><b>Status:</b> <i>noun</i>. the official classification given to a person, country, or organization, determining their rights or responsibilities. <br /></blockquote><br />So much of what I see from day to day seems to be in the pursuit of status instead of progress. Our move to a smaller apartment was met with much concern, offset only by its address and whereabouts. In this culture where bigger means better, downsizing is seen as a bit of a failure. Houses, cars, and clothes are the most visible manifestations of this trend. Instead of living below your means, we embrace excessive consumption, delayed entry into the workplace... and it's all a dangerous trap.<br /><br />If status was inextricably tied to progress it could work. But it's not. Grandiose properties with luxurious vehicles gracing the driveways could just as easily spell unchecked spending and snowballing debt. Even so, we treat these people differently, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/millionairenextdoor.htm">thinking that they represent wealth and success</a>.<br /><br />Research shows that we could hardly be farther from the truth. The perspective of what weath is differs from those who are rich and those who are not. These perceptions that we have may actually be keeping us from an attainment of affluence, as well as <a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/12/big-meals-overpopulation-and-i.htm">perpetuating traditions that may discourage deliberate thought</a> in what we want our lives to be.<br /><br />Because I want to live my life--and not some default existence--I must pay attention to and customize every decision for the maximum effect. I cannot do this effectively if I subscribe to some external standardization that gives me the "right" to certain things. The panhandler has the same right to respect and consideration as I do, and if I am infinitely wealthy but choose to dress like my brother on the street it should not be considered anything other than my choice.<br /><br />Status quo is static; progress is varying and dynamic. To which will you pledge your allegiance?<br />

BODY:
Today my father married his third wife. I mulled over the idea of not attending, but decided to go. As fate would have it, we ended up missing the ceremony completely. There were apparently no hard feelings, though, as followed the party to the reception before heading home.<br /><br />It's not easy to watch anyone marry a third spouse. You begin to wonder why they're trying again, what will they gain from yet another endeavor, and, especially, whether they've modified their selection criteria since the last time. It's harder still when it's your father, to whom you owe half of your genes directly (and the other specifically through his preference). You want to wish them good luck, but you'd rather investigate for a good reason.<br /><br />Perhaps that explains why today was the second time in my life that I've met the woman who now could technically petition to be called stepmother. The first time was over Thanksgiving, and I assume that is sometime near the beginning of their relationship; I have no idea. Honestly, last week I was asking my sister what her name was. Again. And it didn't help that I was told of the plan to marry about six weeks ago, and the ceremony was expedited--a month earlier than originally stated. By the time my MapQuest placed me at the church 30 minutes late, having missed the entirety of the ceremony, I couldn't muster any more suspicious confusion if I tried.<br />
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
The trick, though, is to blame this all on my dad. Rather than chalk this up to the machinations of a secretive and conniving black widow who has it out for my father's blood, that is. Because honestly, who'd want to think that their father would hop into such deep level of relationship without even really working you into the equation? Despite my natural tendency to defend my father's logic, today I must look find him guilty of putting his family at a disadvantage.<br /><br />We now have the uphill battle of befriending someone who is already to be considered a part of us. We now must open our arms without abandon to a mere acquaintance--someone I've seen less than <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2008/04/abandoning-status.htm">my neighborhood panhandler</a>.We must do the work of <i>courting her</i> after the wedding.<br /><br />My work revolves around understanding experiences, so I embrace the opportunity to feel something new. Today, as my father makes post-honeymoon plans to jettison his possessions and move in with his new bride (address unknown), I certainly have something different to add to my collection of unique scenarios. <br /><br />Thanks dad, and best wishes to you and your beautiful bride.<br />

We've long forgotten what we were supposed to memorialize, dividing up the duty between the more ideological Independence day and the more recognizably named Veteran's day. So on this special day that few celebrate but even fewer have to work on, I've decided to reinvent Memorial Day. Here's my idea:<br /><br /><div align="center"><i>Memorial Day: The day we celebrate remembering things.<br /></i></div><br />We'll eat food from recipies we haven't googled, and have fun activities from yesteryear like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_%28game%29">Concentration</a> and <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/180049">Husker Du</a>. What's more, we'll call up our friends to join us--dailing their actual numbers instead of <a href="http://www.plexusweb.com/staff/charlie/blog/post/193/How-Many-Phone-Numbers-do-you-Remember">using voice activation and speed presets</a>.<br /><br />Orators' rhetoric will be the fireworks of the day; prompters and cue cards will have the day off, and festivals will be held showcasing speakers of all age groups reciting memorized <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/">passages of years gone by</a>. Far from the lectern will the speech-reading presenter be banished. Prizes will be awarded for those who can recognize past presidents by face (not just the scandalous ones).<br /><br />When you think about it, there's really something ironic about celebrating how little we bother remembering things on a holiday now most associated with the opening of public swimming pools. Perhaps, it might also give us pause to reflect one what society really gains--or loses--when we relieve ourselves of mental burden.

<p>For the few of you that are still subscribed, or occasionally check in, yet do not already know, I've picked up a second job. It'll be my primary job, and my freelance consulting (which I've still never formally announced) will be accepting new work on a very limited basis.</p>
<p>Back in September, when I <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2007/08/why-im-leaving-my-job.htm">left my job</a>, I hoped that someday I could come back and work in a capacity where my passions were more accurately applied and when there was more incentive to change things for the better. Today, as an Assistant Director of Communication for the Seventh-Day&nbsp;Adventist Church, I've got more opportunity to do what I hoped than I ever <a href="http://twitter.com/Leftsider/statuses/830370080">imagined possible</a>.</p>
<p>This is a good thing. It means more action here on Leftsider, less clandestine activity, and a whole new realm of projects which I hope to showcase as they grow. In my mind, I totally envision this turning out not unlike <a href="http://www.andrewmager.com/">Mager's blog</a>, but man I've got a long way to go for that; I'll settle for something slightly more animated than what <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/">Jan's blog</a> has become. ;)</p>
<p>I guess that means I'll be involving you as well. Look to see comments return in the near future. It'll be great to see what you think of the new chapter we've begun.</p>

If you know me, you know I'm privy to far-reaching, barely logical, nearly irrelevant ideas. Like the time that I tried to get Cesar to take up fencing with me (neither of us did). Or when I <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2007/11/house-and-home.htm">made my wife stop cleaning the house</a>. To me, it's precisely the novelty of it all that makes it worthwhile. Which is why it seems I'm following <a href="http://twitter.com/Joi/statuses/841188238">Joi</a> once again (the first time was with <a href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2007/05/25/neti-pot.html">neti pot</a>), undertaking this <a href="http://hundredpushups.com/">Hundred Pushups</a> meme. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.hundredpushups.com/"><img src="http://hundredpushups.com/images/onehundred468x60.gif" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I can't think of one thing that I want that will be achieved by doing this, nor can I think of one ability i'll have that I don't currently possess. Perhaps it's the mental discipline that's attracting me; heaven knows I could use some. Either way, I'll go through with it and see you on the other side. ^^<br /><br />Better yet, why don't you join me? You can look sexy for the last months of beach season...<br />

If you really want to be a magnetic personality, you have put out a little. <br /><br />Despite the existing duties of work (two jobs, now) and school, I've taken it upon myself to rouse my friends and associates out of their suburban stupor and get them active, socially and/or physically. To this end I established B.A.S.T.I.O.N., Bryan Against Suburban Tendencies of Inactivity, Obstinacy and Negativity. Our first event was in October (I think). It was a variant on the <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/15-09/st_pechakucha">Pecha Kucha</a> meme that we named 20twenty.<br /><br />Right now, the event of the moment is "<b>Galaxies Unite!</b>", an outing to see MLS teams DC United and LA Galaxy battle it out at RFK Staduim in Washington, D.C. Soccer enthusiasts and fans of <a href="http://www.davidbeckham.com/">David</a> (and <a href="http://www.people.com/people/victoria_beckham">Victoria</a>) Beckham have been assembled to go and watch and enjoy the day.<br /><br />Most people don't know is that planning an event is a complex and stressful process that isn't for the faint of heart. It takes a lot of risk and "testicular fortitude" to keep it from falling through; basically think of the entire event as resting on your shoulders. Here's a sneak peek into what is making this event work.<br />
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
Milli was really the one who announced the game. After receiving her email, I asked if I could make it an event. Placing it on Facebook, it quickly generated a lot of interest. We quickly had nine definite attendees and ten maybes. <br /><br /><div class="thumbnail"><div align="center"><a href="http://skitch.com/leftsider/qwxd/facebook-events"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080627-nkruduknm1cnysni63y42ssrqd.preview.jpg" alt="Facebook | Events" /></a><br /></div><br />At this point, group ticketing was a viable option. Milli and I discussed, and we thought it would be worth it. The issue: for this event package deals started at twenty people. This means we needed to solidify those maybes into tangible bodies. I took up the challenge, deciding that the value of this event was worth the cost; I bought the tickets personally. <br /><br />When you've just made a purchase for $800 worth of tickets and you haven't collected a dime towards the cost yet, a bit of panic sets in. This is a good thing. You channel that energy into <br />the promotion of the event and the persuasion of possible attendees. Every day, you wake up thinking about ways to keep from eating the cost.<br /><br />Of the nine original confirmed attendees, at least four have backed out. Even so, right now I think I only have three tickets left, and I'm offering two of those today as a bridge to new relations with my neighbors (who we've not really engaged since moving in). With one unassigned ticket left, I consider this another considerable achievement and a sure sign of event success. The confidence of accomplishment that you get here is a euphoric antitype of the panic you had a week ago.<br /><br />This is, in my opinion, living life. Stepping a few paces further out than you are prepared for and making back by a before-undiscovered will and resolve. It is the core generator of B.A.S.T.I.O.N., as well as the secret of successful business. Learn it now and use it in your future.<br /></div>

I've been asked by the church I attend to be director of Young Adult Ministries. I'm not sure how I feel about that, so I suggested that I'd prefer if I could use this capacity to generate data on who young adults are, their interests, values, and concerns; this data I would then hand over to a team of young adults that I'd help to create new and pertinent programming.<br /><br />Wikipedia says that a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_%28psychology%29">young adult is between ages 18 and 40</a>. If you know anything about that age group you will know that:<br /><blockquote><ul><li>They are least likely to be at church.</li><li>They are least likely to be at church on time.</li><li>They are least likely to be at church long after the service is done.</li></ul></blockquote>So how do you poll the disillusioned, the disinterested and the easily dispersed?

I knew that if I narrowed my survey down to about a dozen questions, it could still take 30 minutes per person. I'd be lucky to get 6 people in the 6 weeks I was given to work on the project.&nbsp; I needed a way to hit many people at once, in a way that would catch them no matter where they were. <br /><br />Text Messaging.<br /><br />I don't know one person at my church, high school age or older, that doesn't have a mobile phone (this knowledge is supported by the 2-3 phones that tend to go off every service). What if I just had them send me their answers via SMS?

It's just like American Idol! It also allows for "free text" responses, which allow for personal answers rather than choosing from a pre-selected set.<br /><br />The novelty and portability qualifications were met, but I still needed a way to get the questions to them--without manually sending SMS to individual mobiles. Luckily, a link showed up at the bottom of my SMS when testing the poll--one for www.41411.com, the same number to which I had cast my vote.<br /><br />The address sends directs you to <a href="http://www.textmarks.com/">TextMarks</a>, a web app which PollEverywhere uses. It allows you to create SMS mailing lists, for lack of a better description.

This could be good for coordinating an event or a ton of other group activities (espionage, anyone?).<br /><br />All said, it seems to work out pretty well. As long as you generate a decent sample size, this could be a free, simple and convenient option for creating your own SMS based survey.<br />

<p>Lately I've been wondering whether I'm a good person or a bad person.</p>
<p>I don't think I've done anything too bad; not that I can recall. But I wonder, are good things what make me a good person? Is it&nbsp;a ratio of good versus bad deeds that determines our goodness quotient? If a genuinely good person does several bad things, is he now a bad person or were those actions done "out of character?"</p>
<p>Moreover, if I do good things only so that I might be seen as good and might generate public consensus to my will based on my reputation, am I still a good person? I would consider that person to be of the most reprehensible villiany that mankind can observe, yet all that she or he has done would be good. If a bad person does good things for an ultimately bad purpose, does that make the good deeds "not good"?</p>
<p>At this stage in my philosophical contemplations, I'm trying to determine what a good person is. Sofar I've come to this: we are forced into socially accepted norms of goodness and virtue. When we gain freedom from these restrictions, or a power that can make us exempt from them, our true identities are revealed. As a theist, I imagine my ultimate power or form-maker; what if there were no god or I was that god? If I look honestly, I see myself having much different actions than I do now; then I imagine, say,&nbsp;Siddhartha Gautama (who was not god nor claimed to be)&nbsp;reaching enlightenment yet leaving its bliss to share the path to others, and I see the distance between me and what I imagine as Good.</p>
<p>Am i a bad person then? Hmm... still out to lunch on that one. But I think it's all a matter of <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2008/02/the-stroke.htm">the strokes I make</a> in the process of making my life, and <a href="http://www.43things.com/entries/view/2930645">making it better</a>.</p>

FWIW the song was actually playing in the restaurant I was sitting in when I recorded this--that's how I was able to include the ambient sound.<br /><br />The video doesn't make sense, but I get it; hope I'm not the only one.<br />

BODY:
I can't find an excuse to have a kid.<br /><br />I like kids. I dote on them, try to be an example to them, try to inspire them and encourage and validate their inquisitive tendencies. I love to ruffle their hair in that older brother way and corral them into an affirming squeeze. <b>I think this is one of the most important things I can do for my society.</b> And I think they really appreciate it; I guess.<br /><br />But for the most part, I pity them. Many times they are the product of a naïve wish or lack of planning. When they are realistically and properly realized, they are often meticulously bred to be the crowning achievement of their parents wishes and aspirations. I think it most selfish to have a child to create a new, improved version of you. Increasingly I think the answer is to let a child be who they can be (an intentional alternative from letting them be who they are).<br /><br />Still, I have love to give. I energy and emotional support to offer in the development of life. In fact, <b>I believe this is my most important mission as a world citizen.</b> If this is what I'm going to do, and I intend to do it objectively, do I have to create a new life to do it? Adoption seems the most logical option.<br /><br />We've talked a bit about this, and we're kinda set on it. But in our minds, the concept of having a family always invloved <i>children</i>, not a child. Why? Because we are both of the opinion that an only child has less incentive to embrace concepts like sharing and collaboration. Regardless of the validity of that statement, it brings out a horrible and calculating reality: <b>Our only reason for a second child would be to improve the outlook of the first.</b> No doubt we could love and cherish that child, but their existence is as a component, not at all independently valid. I think this is most heartless. <br /><br />So now I need to learn to appreciate the single child concept, or resign myself to no children at all? I have a tendency to be excessive in contemplation, so maybe I'm overthinking this. Maybe there's a better option I haven't though of? <br />

BODY:
I was goofing around my grandparent's house, which wasn't actually
their house but the house of the grandparents of some childhood friends
from long ago. I remembered when the neighboring houses were nothing
but fields that we used to play hide and seek in. Running around in the
dark, until I realized that some new resident was washing dishes in the
sink just a few feet away, exposed to me by a kitchen window. <br /><br />I back
away softly while waiting to see their face. It never happens. I turn
to see the ice cream truck that's headed my way on the night street
make a sharp right and drive up the stairs of a cupcake shop; the truck
nimbly makes a 180 turn and drives back down as I wonder if he sells
the cupcakes along with his strawberry shortcake popsicles, which I now
want. I race after him, and decide to give chase as far as it takes. <br /><br />At
the end of the street I must open a door to continue, and there I run
into my grandmother with groceries in her hands. Though I am not
supposed to leave, she is not at all angry (or surprised). She feigns
ignorance as she walks on to wards the house. I set off running again,
though beyond this door there is freezing rain. The ground is slushy
and I slide as if I am ice skating, happy to be free. I think to myself
that I want to twitter, "Running t-shirted in the freezing rain. I feel
like <a href="http://twitter.com/Brad">@brad</a>." I need to revise my wording. <br /><br />I jump in a skip kind of way,
being careful not to slip and fall. The last time I jump too high and
float in to the arms of a medium-sized tree that lines the sidewalks.
Rather than alert the people who were walking in front of me, I jump
again and land on the roof of the nearby building (which I think is
this tire shop I really live by) on the roofs now, with no one to alarm
or disturb, I run and leap and soar at full speed, recklessly. I
realize I'm too high, too fast and as I touch down onto a large
commercial roof I just take off sliding. I slide off the edge onto
another building, and another, until I'm running out of buildings and
approaching a treed neighborhood. I jump at the last building and try
my best preparation to an unwanted land in suburbia. <br /><br />Somehow I land on
a house but inside the house; on a very high ledge where the floor is
far below me and filled with stuffed animals. I contemplate which
plushy item will absorb the sound and impact of my fall, but then I
hear noise. Afraid that the inhabitants have already heard me land, I
quickly drop down as silently as I can and dart to the back door. While
opening and making my way out I realized I can't sprint nearly as long
as I'd want because I just finished running and skipping there. I need
to hide<br /><br /><br />

[quickly bryan, it's fading]<br />
<br />
I run two blocks not
turning to look if the people I see are running after me. I hang a left
and then a right at the next block. I see some others running and I
don't have time to see if they're in pursuit, just working not to be
seen by them. I duck up a driveway and fall back on what I think is the
back of the house, squeezing myself low between two large and low
items. These other guys come a'runnin', and they end up in the same
place I am. Their clothes look dated, and they're whoopin' and
hollerin' like they were bandits out old west. A few climb up just in
front of me, and I realized I'm sitting between two tires of an
18-wheeler. They pull off and I can feel the turning wheels catching on
my sleeves <br />
<br />
[protective dreaming? I thought I was t-shirted?]<br />
<br />
The
driver
was wearing a red blindfold over his eyes and was the coolest of
the gang, maybe the leader. I'm looking up at him as if the truck is
made of air and I'm sitting in the engine. He works to keep his
blindfold from falling down, then signals for a cigarette, which he
smokes casually while driving boldly (and blindly). They were singing a
song that had the same spirit but sounded nothing like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc2mqOac6uo">Bob Seger's
"Ramblin Man."</a> <br /><br />I can't remember
how I got free of that but again I was free and I ran to a house that
was a restaurant and I sat at a table. A girl came and sat there though
I knew she felt obligated to be there. I tried my best to be... to be
behaved? I laid a folder on the table, a folder that was actually a
folder fru designed in college that she showed me last night. The girl
opened it and there was a beautifully drawn picture of her. I looked at
the picture; then I looked at her. I loved her, and she knew it. And I
knew that she knew this was what I was giving her. She smiled
gorgeously and said, "I'm gonna go, but I want to keep this." I looked
at her, and I knew she was saying "no, but I'll take what you give
anyway." <br /><br />I looked down at the photo and it started turning colors: the
paper fading to an antiqued yellow and the ink that defined her into a
beautiful dark green. I thought to myself about twittering to <a href="http://staires.org/">@brad</a>
again: "d brad now I understand you, man." Then I realized that this
girl was a woman I met last night ( a client's wife). Then I realized that I wasn't in
the restaurant but I was lying on a floor cushion in my living room.
Then I realized I was awake. Then I realized that bandit song was still
playing in my head. Then I realized I still wanted to twitter.
How do you condense this to 140 characters?&nbsp; <br />
<br /><br />More of my <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2007/09/an-example-in-a-dream.htm">dreams</a> are <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2007/03/the-return-of-dreams.htm">scattered</a> through this blog.&nbsp; <br /><br />

Welcome to the end of America. I've been thinking about this a lot recently, and it looks like <a href="http://speedbird.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/thoughts-for-an-eleventh-september-alvin-toffler-hirohito-sarah-palin/">others may be ahead of me</a> in realization. <br /><br />When I was tiny, I asked my grandpa if he was a Democrat. He chuckled; said no. I had heard my parents say they were Democrat, and somehow I already had the notion that all black Americans were. I crinkled my nose in that way kids do when they must finish their vegetables, and he grinned and said something I'll never forget: "Wait till you get your first paycheck, and you'll be Republican too."<br /><br />I was fourteen. Minimum wage was about three dollars. My check and record were hand-written and some magic math had eaten into my part-time payment. I thought about ol' <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/2738468250/">Pop Pop</a>. I was ready to listen.<br /><br />In academy, our government teacher did an excellent job. Every morning Mr. Williams would wake up, record the 6am news bit on <i>Good Morning America</i>, and bring it in to class for us to watch and take notes on. He quizzed us weekly, carving out a capacity for current events while he imparted his wisdom on the beauty of the American politics. It was he who made me Republican, a believer of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States"><i>the republic</i></a>, a society in which every individual could defend their inalienable rights and seek out their own method of success in the world. It made sense,therefore, that Republicans were the initial campaigners for the civil rights of blacks (and that southern Democrats were the greatest obstacle in achievement). In <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy">a democracy</a></i>, majority rules; the people's voice is what determines the law. And since minorities were not people, whose voices were not heard, the law was as it was. It made perfect sense. It was incorrect, but it was commonsensical.<br /><br />Today, things don't make sense:<br /><ul><li>Government is <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-080928bailout-deal-reached,0,2436591.story">purchasing the private sector</a></li><li>Republicans are forcing morals into politics, trampling the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment">First Amendment</a> and my inalienable right<br /></li><li>A minority is harnessing a Democrat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochlocracy">majority rage</a> that makes me <a href="http://twitter.com/Leftsider/statuses/902513599">rather uneasy</a></li><li>The <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/15/business/15sell.php">economy</a>, the <a href="http://defamer.com/5028841/why-the-racy-new-ad-campaign-for-gossip-girl-will-backfire">media</a>, society <a href="mailto:http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/triage/2008/09/father-leaves-n.html">at large</a></li></ul><br />If Mr. Williams is still around, bless his heart, I wonder he'd be willing to explain this again. For, as I remember it, the success of our nation was built upon the cooperative union of the democracy and the republic. That our government had checks and balances that would prevent any Bush (or, perish the thought, Palin) from wrecking up the place if they were a regrettable choice--or the lesser of two evils. That our nation had an American Dream.<br /><br />Over forty years ago, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EWtlAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:James+inauthor:A+inauthor:Baldwin&amp;ei=A3LgSJrZK4uWyATd3N38Cw">James Baldwin</a> penned my answer:<br /><blockquote><blockquote><font style="font-size: 0.8em;">This has everything to do, of course, with the nature of that dream and with the fact that we, Americans, of whatever color, do not dare examine it and are far from having made it a reality. There are too many things we do not wish to know about ourselves. People are not, for example, terribly anxious to be equal (equal, after all, to what and to whom?) but the love the idea of being superior. And this human truth has an especially grinding force here, where identity is almost impossible to achieve and people are perpetually attempting to find their feet on the shifting sands of status. [...] We are controlled here by our confusion, far more than we know, and the American dream has therefore become something much more resembling a nightmare, on the private, domestic, and international levels. Privately, we cannot stand our lives and dare not examine them; domestically, we take no responsibility for (and no pride in) what goes on in our country; and, internationally, for many millions of people, we are an unmitigated disaster.</font><br /><br /></blockquote></blockquote><strike>What we need is not an administration change...</strike> ok what we need besides an administration change is a change in public awareness and involvement. People who recognize cunning yet respond with reason; transparency coupled with actual firsthand observation. It is evident that my principles are not popular opinion. Which gets me thinking: what really do I have here to salvage? Perhaps I am destined to a <a href="http://twitter.com/Leftsider/statuses/915177673">fatalistic</a> awareness like the old Imperial scholars, watching my world <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynastic_cycle">spun round</a>. Or maybe I am feeling a bit like an oppressed protestant, longing for a present-day chance to <a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2004/10/0080240">escape to "new world."</a><br /><br />Whatever the scenario, I am disenchanted with my options for election 2008, and find neither a really capable candidate for accomplishing the type of rebuilding I'm interested in. It will take a generation of correct choices to even entertain the idea that the today's political polarization can be overcome to the benefit our our country. If anyone would like to buy my vote, perhaps this year is the election year I feel American enough to be bought...<br />

<p>Yeah it's way overdue, but, then, what about Leftsider isn't?</p>
<p>After getting really jealous that Mager was enjoying the awesomeness that was An Event Apart San Francisco, I decided that I wouldn't lose anything if I asked my new employers to pay my way to An Event Apart Chicago this October. Turns out I had to turn on the persuasion a little bit, and it was not without its stresses... but I did it. And man am I glad I did. Awesomeness all around.</p>
<p>To cut cost I opted to rent a car and stay with my brother-in-law in Addison. The cost of the rental didn't even cover one night in the Sheraton where the event was held, so I figure it was worth it to take the 25-mile commute.</p>
<p>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img class="mt-image-center" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 20px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" height="375" alt="2943098778_7869ef48f2.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/images/2943098778_7869ef48f2.jpg" width="500" /></span></p>
<p>Since I had heard that other events had "sold out," I assumed that this was going to be a very intimate setting with web bigshots. I also was extremely skeptical if this was even possible. Well, it turned out to be approximately 450 people in a large meeting room--not bad but by no means intimate.</p>
<p><img class="mt-image-center" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 20px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" height="375" alt="2943102226_7378dd1cc1.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/images/2943102226_7378dd1cc1.jpg" width="500" />&nbsp;What made this work was the presence of the presenters in the audience. Not in some green room somewhere or huddled away working on the Next Big Thing™, but there hanging out, being cool, taking notes of other presenters' talks. In a reverse psychology kind of way, it made you really self conscious; If Jeffrey Zeldman is taking notes&nbsp;and gushing on twitter about Dan Cederholm's&nbsp;presentation, why aren't&nbsp;you? This admonition totally worked in favor of the event, which emphasized taking pride in your work and not settling for mediocre craftsmanship.&nbsp;By the end of it, everyone who was there to be impressed what certain that their current work was crap but their next product was gonna shred. Instead of fanboy lines you had&nbsp;people lining up after a talk to actually ask real questions and broaden their understanding of topics discussed--and that says a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Jeffrey Zeldman: Understanding Web Design</strong></p>
<p>An Event Apart co-founder Jeffrey Zeldman started of the event with <span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Understanding Web Design.</span><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>What do web designers need? They need empathy, the ability to feel like web users.&nbsp; 
<li>Your design should seduce users, rather than repel them. 
<li>Sit down and design/write content around how people will use your site. 
<li>Web design is largely self-taught, an education in this area is hard to find. Teaching Excel is not the same as teaching business, teaching Photoshop/Dreamweaver is not the same as teaching web design. 
<li>There's a lack of convention in job titles as much as there is a diverse range of educational backgrounds 
<li>The website is often part of some other department, rather than a its own initiative.&nbsp; 
<li>Web designers have little resources to really know how to get it right (design AND usability) 
<li>Unfortunately journalism on web is mainly focused on what makes money or will be the next big thing rather than what the overwhelming majority of designers are actively doing. 
<li>Landmark web design always fits the content of the creator. 
<li>Good web design is about the character of the content, not the character of the designer.</li></ul>
<div>Tips for designing</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Start with the user/your passion 
<li>Know yourself (in regards to the fit of your position/project) 
<li>Find the right clients (see above) 
<li>Sell ideas, not pixels 
<li>"I don't know" is okay if you are going to research and find out 
<li>Build trust 
<li>Bring out the big guns. Use consultants to reinforce your ideas. 
<li>Create a paper trail 
<li>Never underprice your work 
<li>Say no to SPEC 
<li>Say no to rush jobs 
<li>End with the user/your passion</li></ul>
<div>It's really interesting that despite being underwhelmed by this presentation it was spot-on as far as what this conference should start with: who we are as people responsible for web design and development and how we can improve.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Eric Meyer: Debug / Reboot</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The other founder of AEA, Eric Meyer brought the technical heat. His discussion was largely code-based, showing how CSS can be used to highlight usability and accessibility issues during the development process. 
<div>
<ul>
<li>Developers need to be using CSS for debugging, checking links and accessibility, as it is standards &nbsp;in a way that you customize 
<li>Covers things that fall through validators and might cause issues that aren't immediately available. 
<li>CSS frameworks should really be developed by you, as you'll probably heavily edit any pre-existing framework that you use (that being said, heavy customization makes frameworks your own. It's a build up/tear down conundrum.</li></ul>
<div>Despite being pretty under-educated about this, I immediately see the efficacy of this and hope that every one in the&nbsp;web dev&nbsp;community&nbsp;starts having&nbsp;this level of granularity in their development process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Jason Santa Maria: Storytelling By Design</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I wasn't sure if it was because I told him I worked for a religious organization or if he was following the tweetstream and saw my playful shot during his presentation (me and my big mouth), but it seemed like I was getting a little coolness from the JSM after his talk. Ultimately I did chat with him on a couple of occasions and even got a pic with him so I hope all is cool. :P</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Graphics help resonate the emotions of the story the web tries to tell. 
<li>As a designer, you are the narrator. (not convinced by this.) 
<li>"Design can't not communicate." Everything communicates something, whether you plan for it to or not. 
<li>Constraints are not obstacles... perhaps we're not designing hard enough? 
<li>Communication needs to be based upon precision and clarity (amen!) 
<li>New needs require new solutions, systems and methods 
<li>Basing design upon a ratio and rule; recognizing the application of these ideals are completely different between web and other media 
<li>Greater understanding of CSS and layout can establish more creativity (knowing your boundaries) 
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Creation driven by the message rather than technology</span></li></ul>
<div>I think I can find a lot hidden&nbsp;in this presentation that never really reached the surface. Naturally a presentation of this type can't go too deep into definition--breaking down storytelling is&nbsp;like trying to define romance. Even so, I think this may be the single aspect of creating websites that needs more attention but consistently gets less. As the web is a method of&nbsp;transferring information, technology will never trump the ability to tell a story. In the following Q&amp;A, Jason said it himself: "Putting your site on the web does not make it great." I think that's sorta where I am, unfortunately.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Sarah Nelson: Actionable Ideas</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sarah Nelson works at <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/"><strong><font color="#15488b">Adaptive Path</font></strong></a> as a design strategist. If you want to know how to make successful sites based on user experience, Adaptive Path and <a href="http://www.cooper.com/"><strong><font color="#15488b">Cooper</font></strong></a> are really vanguards of user-oriented design you should come to know. In this presentation, Sarah talks about design criteria. 
<div>
<ul>
<li>Use design criteria to emphasize specific rules for your team to follow 
<li>Constraints are not bad. Constraints are freedom. 
<li>Collaboration doesn't have to be painful. Collectively define the problem at hand, and generate team-supported ideas 
<li>Design criteria need to be actionable items, not esoteric concepts</li></ul>In a sense I felt like this was an extestion to Leah Buley's UX presentation at the IA Summit in Miami earlier this year, So I didn't really give it the attention it deserved. I regret that, because afterwards at lunch I ate with her and we had a great conversation about completely random but fascinating things that made me pretty excited about what she does. Also, in retrospect, I totally shoulda got a pic with her.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Jason Fried: Designing the Details: Beyond the Basics</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Jason Fried is at 37 Signals. Love or hate them, their products do exactly what they advertise and do them well. Jason took an hour to show, through their projects, how you can take your Ikea-esque site and make it into a hand-crafted, high quality project. In each of the points the theme is clearly craftsmanship. &nbsp;</div>
<ul>
<li>weak/normal/strong: &nbsp;sometimes emphasizing an element can be better done by de-emphasizing the surrounding elements 
<li>anticipate the flow, sharpen the focus: make mouse clicks and selected fields work for the user's movement through tasks. 
<li>copywriting is interface design: words are just as effective as graphics in the goal of successful design. Be explicit and communicate naturally rather than in tech-centric jargon. 
<li>timing is everything: factor in erroneous mouse targeting and necessary crossover in selecting on:hover elements. Additionally, very few things happen instantaneously in nature; we are much more accustomed to seeing things change. 
<li>Photographic memory: remember user actions, thereby removing the need for settings and preferences 
<li>Extreme detail: things that really may be overlooked but will be loved by your development team and take quality to the next page. Eliminate error messages, make little known features your audience can discover and enjoy (If you are using a framework, you can install these features across your projects).</li></ul>
<div>Fried notes that they don't use comps, don't use wireframes. Basically he says they make rough sketches (with fat markers to avoid getting to detail oriented) and then go straight to the code. This is interesting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Andy Clarke: Underpants Over My Trousers</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Never heard of this presenter, but Andy Clarke's fantastic approach&nbsp;was a breath of fresh air from the day. Taking cues from the comic book world (hence the heroes with "underpants over their trousers). Points he focused on:

<ul>
<li>How panels direct flow 
<li>How variation in panels add and direct emphasis 
<li>What happens between the panels... is the reader's imagination 
<li>Panels sized by involvement time rather than a grid or length of content 
<li>Emphasis by escaping the panels (selectively) 
<li>Removing assumptions about where the reader has picked up the storyline</li></ul>
<div>Oh how I wish I could've recorded this presentation. Absolutely stellar. I can't express how inspiring this was. And his method was unparalleled: talk about comics, bring about the inspiring connection, show a web implementation, show the code. This is perfection. I've been inspired not only in design but also in presentation style.&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>&nbsp;</div></div><font style="FONT-SIZE: 1.56em">&nbsp;Decompression</font></div>

<div>By this point I think we were all at capacity. There was a special session where an Adobe guy showed some of the coolness (and yes it is ALL COOLNESS) in Creative Suite 4, and after that we all headed out to get loose at Fado Irish pub and grill. I rolled in we a few cool people and headed out with another set, so I consider it a great night.</div>

<p><strong>Rob Weychert: Design Lessons in Chess</strong></p>
<p>Philadelphian designer Rob Weychert took us through lessons learned/reinforced in improving his chess game, particularly the ones that relate to creating for the web. </p>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Some preliminary points:<br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Chronology: Do your backrground work; form a strategy before the game starts. Do research. 
<li>Opening = Information Architecture 
<li>Middlegame = Visual Design 
<li>Strategy vs. Tactics: Strategy is long term goals, whereas tactics are short term moves that fulfill the strategy. Design is a tactic to achieve the strategy of communicating information. 
<li>Endgame = 
<li>Opponent as user, meeting their needs 
<li>Opponent as client, achieving their goals 
<li>Opponent as colleague, challenge each other to push further</li></ul>
<div>Lessons Learned:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Content is King: The king piece, in chess, is the ultimate goal and the focus of all action. In web, everything supports content, which is the greater strategy 
<li>Know Your History:&nbsp; 
<li>Think Ahead: Realize the impact of your moves upon the road ahead, and the responses to those moves. 
<li>Don't Get Too Attached: If you see a good move, look for a better one. Don't settle for the first good thing. 
<li>Act with a Purpose:&nbsp;Cultivate your project around that sole "king" that is your goal in your web project (see Content is King). 
<li>Obey Circumstance: Operate and execute based on need, rather than your existing "bag of tricks." Don't put the solution before the problem 
<li>Principles Are Your Friends. Except When They're Not: Follow established rules, but know why you're doing it. Determine whether they apply to the current situation and work accordingly. 
<li>The Journey is as Important as the Goal: Love your failures; they are the elements that create the successes you have.</li></ul>
<div>Very simple and down-to-earth presentation; his points were very relevant and could probably be more useful than you'd first assume. But then, that's kinda like chess, isn't it?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Dan Cederholm: Implementing Design: Bulletproof A - Z</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Due to family loss, there was a lineup change, but the backup was actually Dan Cederholm, author of <a href="http://simplebits.com/publications/bulletproof/"><strong><font color="#15488b">Bulletproof Web Design</font></strong></a>. His voice will lull you to sleep, but his humor will keep you awake. Case in point: A-Z was changed to A-U because he ran out of tips for all the alphabet (even after skipping a half-dozen letters).&nbsp; 
<div><br /></div>
<div>Even so, there was no way I could capture each letter. Basically the best summary would be the emphasis again on craftsmanship.&nbsp;Craftsmanship in implementation is not immediately noticeable, but is noticeable nonetheless. In many instances, certain features would not be immediately noticeable unless a page was resized or something else exceptional to intended usage. Covering all bases--even the ones that are extreme--is what is means to be "bulletproof."&nbsp;By bulletproof, Cederholm means flexible, adaptable, and effective without complexity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Cameron Moll: The In-House Designer</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cameron&nbsp;designed on his own&nbsp;from 2004 to 2006 before accepting a position on a design team at the LDS church (I, having started my company last year before being picked up by the communication team of the SDA church, was all ears once I heard this).&nbsp; 
<div>
<ul>
<li>In-house designers do 3 things: work, publicity, relationships... 20%, 40%, 40% respectively 
<li>There are few things that build trust better than results. Build relationships that can generate great results. 
<li>Sometimes the best methods of communication are less efficient but more effective. 
<li>Great designers are also great communicators. Great communications skills create the shortest distance between ideas and realization. 
<li>Understanding when to show elements of a product and when to show the product in its entirety. Remove fidelity when it is not necessary for agreement, so that team players can focus on what counts. 
<li>Establish weekly design reviews, in-house workshops, and other tools that develop team skill and experience 
<li>Establish connections with internal departments, local colleges &amp; university, and other relationships that can be mutually influential 
<li>Establish a culture and environment that fosters creativity.</li></ul>
<div>Just a few of many very useful points that would be useful for any communication department (Adventist entities don't have design departments, do they?)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Curt Cloninger: The Arts &amp; Crafts of Web Design</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Curt Cloninger came from left field with this presentation. Not sure how it was received, but there were some definite concepts that were worth discussion in his comparison of websites and arts and crafts. Arts and Crafts:</div>
<ul>
<li>Stays true to the nature of materials.&nbsp;What is the nature of a pixel? A link? A scrollbar? Stay true to that and don't mix up the interaction for users 
<li>Blends of artistry and handicraft. The web is a blend of design and development, and your skillset determines your output. 
<li>Unites the Microcosmic and Macrocosmic. The web also allows us to detail to level which ultimately designs harmonious (and sometimes excessive) themes. The web can be ornate. 
<li>Values Utility and Beauty. There is a value in effectiveness, but also in aesthetic. There is a value in Beauty (and solely beauty?). Adding aesthetic elements correctly can provide value. 
<li>Is Enjoyable. Create what you want. If the tools are not there to make what you want, create the tools. Be immersed and involved. 
<li>Redesigns the World. Take your work beyond the parameters of your project. Design your users. Design the project's environment.</li></ul>
<div>Ultimately, he encouraged the audience to go further and do more and become geniuses of their craft.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Jeffrey Veen: Designing the Next Generation of Web Apps</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Jeff Veen. Man. What can you say that can really show how cysed I was about&nbsp;hearing this dude. And he did not disappoint. Jeff took a step back from the craftsmanship&nbsp;minutiae&nbsp;and shows where things are going. Starting in 1974, he oriented our direction with the advent of the video game and the hard drive, and took us through an understanding of where we have come from and what that means for our web creations. 
<div>
<ul>
<li>Tools for participation and scale of data: from 1974 to the future, the direction of the web. 
<li>Every minute of the day, 24 hours a day 18 hours of video is uploaded to Youtube. 
<li>If things make you (the designer) feel stupid, it's probably not your fault; it's the presentation. 
<li>The presentation of data can alter the response from the audience, negating the default desensitization of statistics</li></ul>Tips for displaying information<br />
<ul>
<li>Assign different visual cues to each dimension of data. 
<li>Remove everything that isn't telling the story 
<li>Provide filters to enable clarity</li></ul>
<div>Direction</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Designers will need to learn to operate without total control. Users will determine device and layout. 
<li>Give tools to people to create their own stories with your information. Use the data itself as a mechanism for navigation (google analytics is an excellent example of this). 
<li>70% of google traffic originates outside of the United States 
<li>Under 25 internet users, born into a web world assume their web information is public unless made private, over 25 assumes private unless made public. 
<li>New ideas come from your heart, not your wallet.</li></ul>
<div>I was surprised that the event was not so much about the future of the Web as it was the state of the designer. To that end, Veen's presentation really did a good job of answering that expectation while still keeping in the conference spirit that the future of the web is in the hands of the designers right now--today. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img class="mt-image-center" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 20px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" height="375" alt="2946085684_d33016bec6.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/images/2946085684_d33016bec6.jpg" width="500" /></span></div>
<div align="center"><em>Look at how tall this dude is! Also, Zeldman in the&nbsp;back, left.</em></div>
<div align="center"><em></em>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Coming to the end of this two-day session, I'm convinced again that the future of the Web is in my hands. I need to stop trying to do what is normal and start hand-crafting again--bringing a level of effective quality and creativity that is more appropriate to the Web's potential. First day back in the office I&nbsp;knocked out two phenomenal solutions that would have otherwise been mundane. I need to attend stuff like this more often to keep my thinking sharp.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So that was Chicago. And that's about it.</div></div></div>&nbsp;</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

BODY:
In <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2009/02/managing-design-projects.htm">my post about the Adaptive Path conference</a> I made reference to my "failures and middling achievments." I'd like to be a little more specific.<br /><br />Since I <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2008/06/status-report.htm">started the new job</a>, I've been less successful than I had anticipated. I focused too much on defining myself outside of the shadow of my predecessor. I moved hastily to motivate people and create a third culture of design. I worked hardest at deadline times, waiting for launches to expose flaws that I could mend. In retrospect, these are all things that work well for a freelancer or sole proprietor--when you are the lead--but not at all useful when establishing the relationships that make a team.<br /><br />What team building requires is must more evolving than immediate; it starts at the familiar and smooths the transitions, and works were everyone feels most comfortable. I assumed that I would either have a team already versed in design or the jurisdiction to establish parameters, and with neither my work suffered dearly. Projects languished where there was an absence of collaboration, and all tasks were equally weighted--and equally demanded. <br /><i><br />Managing Design Projects</i> opened my eyes to my own shortcomings as much as it gave new ideas and strategies. Of particular note:<br /><ul><li>I was not as cognizant of personalities as they relate to team interaction. I must approach people in a way that they feel most comfortable.</li><li>I failed to create a protocol for task management, as well as a record of goals achieved. I seem to be totally busy, but have shown very little for it.</li><li>I've not made design and design research plain enough for non-inclined to see value. Without value, there is little incentive to maintain (I also never expected such an aversion to reading! wow!).</li></ul>But these are all things I can change. I'll just have to start a little deeper, a little slower, and, most likely, with a little less group enthusiasm to use as inertia. I look forward to actually opening the book they gave us, and really setting up a management program based on proven methods. If it's proven and within my power, it's something I can believe in. <br />

I have merely commented on what their machinations produce. What they produce, I will repeat, is often far less than is what is necessary to effect change.<br /><br />Why? Because we have forgotten why protest exists and, by extension, have lost the true purpose.<br /><br />If you ask a modern protester why they are protesting, I expect (perhaps incorrectly) that responses will be variations upon this theme: people need to be made aware of this problem, and if enough people are made aware, change will naturally occur. This response is neither logical nor proven, and the less active the protester, the less likely the change to happen.<br /><br />Mass numbers prove nothing but solidarity. It does not prove (or improve) competency or the ability to respond. All the third graders in the US may sign a petition to make recess three hours, but they have no ability to change the rules nor do they understand the ramifications or processes for making that change. Solidarity is not enough for change.<br /><br />Additionally, solidarity requires certain compromises and acceptances in the name of collective strength. We set aside our differences so that we might be a stronger unit than we are individually, but in achieving a single focus we create a single opponent for our common enemy to defend against. Instead of being devoured by a pack of wolves, the adversary need only slay the giant dragon.<br /><br />And let me assure you, lawmakers, governments and corporate organizations have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/21/AR2007082101662.html?nav=rss_print/asection">effective and established weapons</a> for slaying the dragon. This should come as no surprise; centralized power by its very structure must defend itself from rival power-seekers. Which, as much as you'd like to believe otherwise, is exactly what your empowered structure would do once enabled.<br /><br />But this is where the internet is so wonderful. It gives us the opportunity for loosely organized groups, who can be made aware of what is happening yet work either independently or collectively, as the task permits. A thousand calls to a lawmakers office or $10 from a thousand people to hire the best litigator/lobbyist/celebrity activist to champion their cause and assert their influence, all at literally the the speed of the internet itself.<br /><br />But as a lover of the internet, I digress. There is more to why protests fail to be effective.<br /><br />It is because we are lazy. Unbelievably lazy. Lazier than really should be possible, but we have created systems to allow us unprecedented levels of lazy. There is a cost to being able to effectively argue against a law, and we are not interested in paying it. At a much lower cost, we can hire someone to argue for us, or (even cheaper) we can contribute to a "cause" where someone else determines who to hire and how to pay them. We put a check in the mail, get a ribbon magnet in return, and call it a day.<br /><br />There is a cost to fighting injustice and wrong, but we don't want to be bothered. So we give up responsibilities to an elected group of individuals who can handle them for us. We give them the right to break our laws so that they can maintain peace. And when they misuse their authority we somehow are appalled by their behavior.<br /><br /><b>Answer this question:</b> <i>What is more appalling? A man, given greater power than the general population, misusing it in an already hostile situation, or dozens of people, watching (recording!) the situation escalate to its fatal conclusion, never once thinking to use their numbers to subdue the situation themselves?</i> The irony is that the time for true protest was brought about by someone calling the authorities and complaining rather than ending the situation themselves. And the tragedy is that the time for true protest was completely lost on the audience, severed in the video above by the closing of the BART doors.

<br /><br />On March 7, 1965, about six hundred people crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in a march centered around voter rights for people of color. When they reached the other side, they found state troopers blocking their path, telling them to return to Selma. As they stood there, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s00-OoZAWno">news cameras recorded the gas-masked policemen attacking the unarmed, non-combative line of marchers with clubs and tear gas</a>(link to video above). Many were hospitalized, their injuries so severe.<br /><br />George B. Leonard wrote a powerful recollection in <i>The Nation</i>, which is, unfortunately, <a href="http://www.thenation.com/archive/detail/13588215">not freely available</a>:<br /><blockquote>We were in our living room in San Francisco watching the 6pm news. I was not aware that at the same moment people all up and down the West Coast were feeling what my wife and I felt, that at various times all over the country that day and up past 11pm Pacific Time that night hundreds of these people would drop whatever they were doing, that some of them would leave home without changing clothes, borrow money, overdraw their checking accounts; board planes, buses, trains, cars; travel thousands of miles with no luggage; get speeding tickets, hitchhike, hire horse drawn wagons; that these people, mostly unknown to one another, would move for a single purpose: to place themselves alongside the Negroes they had watched on television.<br /></blockquote>When the march was attempted again on March 21, <i>thousands of people</i> from around the country walked with those who had attempted earlier.<br /><br />You see, my friend, protest is not about awareness; media is about awareness. protest is not about others changing things--it is about <b>you</b> contributing your time, energies and efforts independently because you feel that <b>YOU</b> must change a grave error, whether you feel that your sole contribution can create change or not.<br /><br />Anything else is just modified whimpering. You are no more a protester than those sheep who didn't bumrush that asshole BART officer who <i>visibly broke the law</i>. And in my opinion, if you're not willing to fight for right than you have no reason to complain; either your battle is on another front, or you are not <strike>fighting</strike> living at all.<br /><br />True change is in your hands. <a href="http://reportingcivilrights.loa.org/authors/selections.jsp?authorId=42">Your senses have been dulled</a>, but that does not mean that the power is not still yours to weild. Like others before us, we must come to drop our lives for the sake of others--only then will protest be valuable again. And only then can we truly call ourselves a superior species. <br /><br />

In direct contrast to <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2009/02/protest-in-the-age-of-detached.htm">my last post</a>, this entry leaves my fellow man high and dry while I am selfishly complacent. Yep, I'm pretty happy that I'm ok while the world is not so great, so you're not going to see me in the streets protesting. <br /><br />2008 and 2009 (sofar) have been generally successful years for my family unit. Towards the end of last year we had become commercially debt-free (we still have student loans) and currently we're living with a decent monthy surplus. Everyone is worried about losing their job in an economic season such as this--myself included--but otherwise I've got little to keep me awake at night.<br /><br />In fact, it wasn't until this weekend that the proximity of the financial crisis really revealed itself; our dinner guests announced that the expected to face foreclosure on their condo. Well, I knew a few people who were laid off, but people are always getting laid off--it's another story altogether when someone loses their home.<br /><br />I guess I have a few things to be thankful for, the greatest of which probably is my upbringing in an economically distressed environment. Subsequently I know:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>How to prioritize needs <i>and</i> wants.</b> Most people can separate their needs <i>from</i> their wants, but haven't taken to prioritizing the respective categories. I was a kid who understood seemingly from birth why the phone would be disconnected for two weeks (so the electric stays on, duh). When you don't have enough to cover everything, you <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29282884/">cover what's essential</a>.</li><li><b>Happiness isn't about size.</b> Americans have this funny concept that the bigger you have it, the better you are. Ironically, this seems to be indicative of <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2006/12/big-meals-overpopulation-and-i.htm">people who have no experience with the good life</a>. Others <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/consumption">have noted this</a> as well.<br />When you live smaller, you train yourself to be more efficient. This efficiency allows you to more aptly manage growth when it comes.</li><li><b>Ownership isn't everything.</b> It is a lot of expense and responsibility. What's the payoff? If you can't afford it, don't own it--and if the bank can take it from you, it was never yours to begin with. Some reports claim <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2009/02/25/real_estate/boomer_wealth_evaporating/index.htm">renters in 2004 are wealthier</a> today than their owning peers.</li><li><b>I can save resouces by learning from others.</b> We all don't have to make the same mistakes. I spent a year or so reading <a href="http://boards.fool.com/Messages.asp?bid=100158">advice on frugality</a> from Fools (before it went paysite status) and I love resources like <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/">I Will Teach You to Be Rich</a>. When you're poor, you don't have the option of second tries, so getting good info is crucial.</li><li><b>To budget like crazy.</b> Back of an envelope? Sure. Complex spreadsheet? Now we're talking. Round up every expense to give yourself a cushion. Round down every income to guarantee your budget will work. And surplus is for savings, not your reward for doing well. Again when you don't have cash, you're forced to do these things to make ends meet.</li><li><b>Credit is the enemy.</b> If you're unable to pay, they won't give you credit. If you can pay yourself, they'll give you all the credit you need? That's bull. I'm not going to say cut all your credit cards, but know that's just a losing battle. If you can, get an American Express card so you must pay in full every month. If that sounds pointless, that's the point.</li><li><b>Debt wins over savings.</b> If you must choose, eliminate debt. Meager interest earned on a nest egg is actually costing you if your credit card finances at a higher rate. Downside? Right now we don't have much savings--<i>but we have no debt</i>, and the money we paid to debt now becomes our regularly scheduled surplus.</li></ul>I think a lot of people really never understood money to begin with. It's somewhat sad to see an entire country screwed when every few people really knew what they were getting themselves into. But it is 100% possible to learn, adapt and progress--it'll just take intense effort, which is in line with my previous entry after all. :)<br /><br />While one half of the aforementioned guests had largely given up hope and resigned themselves to destitution, the spouse, who was born in Dominican Republic and was the product of self-effort felt, like me, that this is just another thing that we can overcome. The human species is an amazing one, and an economic downturn creates a ripe environment for showing exactly what makes us so.<br /><br />Here's to personal creative dismantling of our collective woes, for the better you <i>and</i> me. <br />

BODY:
Because I'm now an old geezer, I often feel that I'm behind the ball on great and emergent music. I like to see what other people are listening to, and Twitter exponentially expands the range that you can poll.<br /><br />So recently I asked for five (5) artists that define one's current musical landscape. Slightly more functional than a "stranded island" playlist, while much less permanent than a "favorite artists" roster. A number of people responded, their lists as varied as the individuals themselves:<br /><br /><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="dgroundsel.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/images/dgroundsel.jpg" class="mt-image-left" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; float: left;" height="399" width="611" /></span><br /><br /><a href="http://twitter.com/dgroundsel/">@dgroundsel</a>, a self-described <a href="http://www.chinscratcher.com/">chinscratcher</a> and otaku who lives somewhere quite near me apparently, stayed true to form with this eclectic and efficient set of artists that blur the lines between what is sound and what is music. I'd add a personal extension of this list by including Towa Tei or a Rei Harakami.<br /><br /><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="aebsr.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/images/aebsr.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="400" width="613" /></span><br /><br /><a href="http://twitter.com/aebsr/">@aebsr</a>, a fellow designer/developer in the greater DC area, provides a very safe yet compelling set anchored firmly in soul. We're friends on <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/aebsr/">last.fm</a>, where I share a common vein in hip hop appreciation but part ways in his tolerance of R&amp;B. At some point we going to have to sit down and sort out our differences; we are fellow contrarians as well.<br /><br /><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="justinbaum.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/images/justinbaum.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="468" width="613" /></span><br /><br /><a href="http://twitter.com/justinbaum/">@JustinBaum</a>'s list probably excites me the most. A San Fran web des/dev/PM that I met briefly at <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2009/02/managing-design-projects.htm">a conference earlier this year</a>, he's also a DJ--a passion I've had to suppress for one reason or another for the past 5 years. DJs cultivate this really fun habit I call "theming": finding and utilizing obscure commonalities in vastly differing types of music. Looking at his list made me eager to see what that theme was.<br /><br /><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="brad.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/images/brad.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="433" width="609" /></span><br /><br /><a href="http://twitter.com/brad/">@brad</a> is perhaps my longest-running twitter relation, and we get on like yin and yang: white/black,&nbsp; east coast/west coast, older/younger--you name it, and we balance it out. Brad has a massive collection I've had the opportunity to peruse, and, as such, he's the most confusing as far as music taste is concerned. He listens to nearly everything; perhaps more than any other this list identifies exactly what he's listening to at this moment instead of in general.<br /><br /><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="smellvin.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/images/smellvin.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="360" width="610" /></span><br /><br /><a href="http://twitter.com/smellvin/">@smelvin</a> is my colleague and corporate partner in crime. You'd never get that from this list. I'm appreciative of EW&amp;F and Sample, skeptical of common (though I was a big fan in his early days), and barely tolerant of musiq and stevie. I know I'll get flack for this scathing review, but it just goes to show, perhaps, that opposites attract?<br /><br /><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="gorgeoux.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/images/gorgeoux.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="400" width="610" /></span><br /><br /><a href="http://twitter.com/gorgeoux/">@gorgeoux</a>, a Romanian media expert who has since transplanted herself in London, is another long-term twitter relation; we like to wax eloquently in <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2009/02/protest-in-the-age-of-detached.htm">DM debates</a>. :) A very nice grouping here which reminds me that I've not listened to Talvin Singh in a very long time, which is a very sad thing.<br /><br /><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="etmueller.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/images/etmueller.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="430" width="610" /></span><br /><br /><a href="http://twitter.com/etmueller/">@etmueller</a> is my German younger brother (really! ask my mom! haha) who's now holding it down in SoCal. He's quite conservative musically, which would explain why I've never heard of most of his list. I'd be remiss if I didn't check these artists out. On a side note, however, I think Vivaldi was the only artist mentioned twice--and on totally differing lists. <br /><br /><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="espresso22.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/images/espresso22.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="435" width="610" /></span><br /><br /><a href="http://twitter.com/espresso22/">@espresso22</a> is works in the office next to mine, and we occasionally share our iTunes playlists. She's young enough that I poll her musical rotations regularly. Her playlist dredges up bittersweet memories of a decade of angst and invincibility. Perhaps I should introduce her to @brad?<br /><br /><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="aebsr2.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/images/aebsr2.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="434" width="610" /></span><br /><br />Naturally, someone couldn't settle on just one list. I think this list is much more indicative of what we have in common musically. Good one @aebsr!<br /><br /><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="funkaoshi.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/images/funkaoshi.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="392" width="612" /></span><br /><br />In many regards, Toronto technophile <a href="http://twitter.com/funkaoshi/">@funkaoshi</a> has a musical taste that mimics mine at his age. Coincidentally, I think I was being heavily influenced at that time by <a href="http://www.milkaudio.com/web/index2.php">Milk</a>, 2kool4radio and other Canada-centric sources. The kid's alright by me, mostly because he justifies my collection. <br /><br /><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="capturingmoods.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/images/capturingmoods.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" height="429" width="613" /></span><br /><br />Finally, the youngest of the bunch (and technically my cousin?) <a href="http://twitter.com/capturing_moods/">@capturing_moods</a> makes me happy that the new sounds that appeal to me are pretty close to the pulse of the next gen. I'll stop now rather than date myself with "I remember when No Doubt..." Oh by the way she has a twitter music feed, <a href="http://twitter.com/indie_rock_life">@indie_rock_life</a>--as does @brad (his is <a href="http://twitter.com/staires">@staires</a>).<br /><br />It's always nice to cross reference your tastes with those around you, be it tangibly or twitterphorically. I wonder what else I can find&nbsp; by attempting a meme (perhaps that I'm not as old as I like to let on)?<br /><br /> <div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>

There are so many things that I wanted to write, and the time just hasn't been there. April found me in 4 different countries and relocating all my belongings to a new apartment. A lot of things have changed, and a lot of things have shone that they've never, ever, changed at all.</p>
<p>I turned 30, and I realized that I'm not young anymore. I've never really wanted to be young; it never fit my tastes. That said, I've enjoyed a rather long period as a dual citizen and am rather concerned that new administrations may not see the virtue in renewing my status. And suddenly, it does matter how young I am.</p>
<p>On my 30th birthday I cut my hair for the first time in 8 years, and I cut it rather short. I had dreamed of doing so for years, but had idea what I'd do next. In fact, I knew what I'd do; I'd be--completely and totally for the first time in a long time. It's interesting to see, subsequently, how many people knew me (vs. how many solely knew my hair-sonality).</p>
<p>&nbsp;I've worked on at least three different themes for Leftsider, never really spending enough time to see them realized before they expire. Creatively, I'm in constant duress; much of my work these days is about troubleshooting, and that is tiring. I hope to adjust the balance very soon.</p>
<p>Overlooked, worn ragged, aging, rebelling, failing to complete. It's who I am. Perhaps someone less inclined to find charm in <a href="http://aenui.com/design/wabi-sabi-zen-aesthetic-principles/">wabi-sabi</a> would&nbsp;find this unpleasant to declare. But you know, there's one more thing I am: not caring--at all.</p>

<p>The problem with religion is&nbsp;its inability override human will.&nbsp;People rarely apply their will deliberately, and when they do, it is often in obstinacy&nbsp;rather than in progress. In the case of religion, much more has been done to prove one's religion absolute than to find the absolute religion. In fact, more has been done to discredit religion altogether than has been done to find its merit.</p>
<p>And religion, folks, isn't a bad thing. It's not a good thing, either; it's<em> just a thing</em>. A codified set of rituals for interacting with the unknown. We're not stupid, and we are hard-wired to persist; therefore, we develop systems&nbsp;for getting along in strange environments. </p>
<p>Religion is pervasive. When crossing a&nbsp;pitch-black room, any of us will:</p>
<ul>
<li>slow down</li>
<li>step cautiously</li>
<li>place our arms in front of us</li></ul>
<p>Why? There's no rule that tells us to do so; somewhere within there is a need to successfully interact with this vague terrain. It's not so far off from a special celebration&nbsp;to welcome the rain, or a shipmate tossed off a boat to appease the offended seas. At its least intelligent, it becomes fruitless superstition (broken mirrors, seeing the bride&nbsp;before the wedding), but at its most intuitive--most spiritual--it develops protective measures and scientific methods of discovery, albeit often via trial and error.</p>
<p>But as potentially enriching as religion could be, it inevitably falls short without adherence. This is obvious in large quantities--if no one pays attention to the rules, the system is of no value. But I believe it is most dangerous in tiny dosages, where abandonment&nbsp;is less of a factor than indifference, tradition and opportunism.</p>
<p>When one abides but has no desire to understand, they risk losing the competency to demand quality and the qualification to participate in development. Religion in its purest form has never been about acquiescence but has completely and passionately fostered the unearthing of truth.</p>
<p>Truth can be re-examined and tested infinitely. It persists because it cannot be bested--not because it is the best we've got. Yet religion fails to our sense of nostalgia--a huge impediment to progress. You cannot go forward when you relish the past. </p>
<p>Most disconcerting are those who see in the aforementioned flaws an opportunity to profit. Capitalism seems to subsist on this selfish premise; perhaps this is why we see power, wealth and religion often so closely related at the upper levels. As long as there is a process in religion that allows even one to suffer from lack of knowledge, that religion is mortally flawed.</p>
<p>In today's option-laden, multi-perspective stream-of-conciousness lifestyle, it takes <a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2008/02/the-stroke.html">tremendous discipline</a> to truly adhere to any religion--theistic or otherwise. It is increasingly portrayed as absurd to devote one's life to pursuing truth. Rabbis, pastors and priests are in disfavor,&nbsp;monks,&nbsp;yogis and holy men&nbsp;are&nbsp;distortedly&nbsp;glamorized,&nbsp;philosophers and dreames&nbsp;are ridiculed. Exertion of will is seen as quaint and inefficient while, simultaneously, coercion of will is a moral affront.</p>
<p>In such an environment, religion, so natural and vital, is ostracized and stripped of value.&nbsp;</p>

I've recently discovered people's dirt. No, really; there's a website--<a href="http://www.peoplesdirt.com/">PeoplesDirt.com</a>--that is causing a local uproar. I heard it when I recently started picking up a local weekly, but it has gotten a WaPo write up <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/13/AR2009051302897.html?nav=hcmoduletmv">twice</a> in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/16/AR2009051602191.html">last week</a>.<br /><br />I find it fascinating. Not the site, it's plain, oddly laid out and uninspiring. It'll never become more than what it currently is. It's the responses of parents and school administrators that has me captivated. Really, I'm not sure there's a TV show more interesting.<br /><br />In their quest to make a <a href="http://www.nysun.com/opinion/americas-worst-mom/74347/">perfectly sanitized and unblemished life for their kids</a>, they've completely forgotten that kids are some of the meanest, most ruthless and vindictive people out there. What keeps them from totally destroying society is the fact that they are minors, the ward of adults. It should be no surprise that today's kids run amok on this website as if it were a modern-day interpretation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies"><i>Lord of the Flies</i></a>.<br /><br />To be certain, I understand their concern. But I also remember my time in high school sharing sexual conquests and pitting myself against rival factions. My last two years were in a boarding academy, where it seemed at least monthly we'd gather in a dorm room with a yearbook and discuss our female classmates' appeal and availability. Even in middle school we did this; I remember the notorious "notebook," which anonymously floated around collecting tallies of the cutest girl, hottest boy, the biggest jerk, and so on. <br /><br />Perhaps it is possible to minimize these kinds of activities, and I think adults are good to curb their prevalence. Yet I cannot understand the local drive to shut down the site and vilify its creator, who apparently moved from the area to Colorado recently. To me it seems like suing <a href="http://www.mead.com/index.html">Mead</a> for making the composition book we passed around in 4th grade.<br /><br />You don't punish the medium. The discussion board is not hurting you or causing you distress. It is your children placing that filth on a perfectly neutral platform. Stop passing the blame and accept that your perfect children are creating the perfect storm. The effort wasted in trying to pull down a perfectly legal (albeit also perfectly repugnant) site is energies that could be to improving our lives and responses to life's difficulties--so that those under our care don't grow up thinking that elitism, mockery and disparaging comments are ever good: <a href="http://tweetingtoohard.com/top">online</a>, at the dinner table, or <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/the-real-housewives-of-new-york-city/videos/counter-points">on the TV</a>.<br /><br />As the internet continues to develop communities that are outside of the scope of traditional methods of dissuasion (social condemnation, lack of majority support, restriction of resources), we will ultimately need to reassess the laws that provide protection and security for our life , liberty and pursuit of happiness. PeoplesDirt is introducing us to smudges of the new world. <br /><br /><br /><br />

There are two reasons why I cut my hair. The first is that I was tired of long hair. I never wanted long hair, I just wanted a hairstyle I didn't have to do anything to. Somewhere along the way, I adopted the persona and maintained it until now, when it was just unreasonable. Think about how many people have had the same hairstyle for 12 years and still are considered fashionable, and you have reason enough to change.<div><br /></div><div>The other reason I didn't realize until after I had cut it. In fact, I didn't realize it until about two weeks ago. Walking on empty streets in an evening rain, I realized I cut my hair to become more like everyone else.</div><div><br /></div><div>At that moment, I realized that I was no longer interested in being better, cooler, more connected, less forgettable. <a href="http://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/2043292763">Social climbing was suddenly repulsive, recognizing that the footholds were other people being stepped on.</a> Every hope of achieving something that another could not was preventing me from the dream of a world that was unequivocally accepting to all.</div><div><br /></div><div>That night, I refrained from tweeting a possibly&nbsp;sacrilegious comment about<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_fig"> searching for a tree to make my enlightenment complete</a>. It seemed as if puzzle pieces had fallen into place, revealing a picture with greater meaning.</div><div><br /></div><div><ul><li>My interest in <a href="http://archives.leftsider.com/2008/04/abandoning-status.htm">removing status</a>, and in being equal or empathetic to all</li><li>My advocacy of public transportation, not only for resource-friendly transport but for a leveling of current socioeconomic isolation and real exposure to the everyday life of others</li><li>My <a href="http://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/1978187171">recent focus</a> on a personal sartorial style that was not label-based or class-indicative</li><li>My continuing reflection on <a href="http://wiki.leftsider.com/tiki-index.php?page=truthAndCulture">truth and its pervasiveness</a> when stripped of culture-specific tradition</li><li>Countless initiatives to bring people together, and to share experiences with a larger audience.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Some had asked, "why did you cut your hair? You just look normal now; you don't stand out," and with each prodding I came closer to belting out the reality, which was even unknown to me--I no longer want to stand out, because standing apart prevents me from being interconnected with all humanity.</div></div>

Nostalgia is never progressive. So when I start waxing poetically about what Twitter used to be, know that I'm totally aware I'm living in the very recent past.<br /><br />You see, I was very early on the Twitter wagon. Before #fixreplies, before the fail whale, before desktop apps and even before @replies. After reading the news of something new on Ev's blog, I joined shortly after launch--August 4, 2006, account number 3796. And so, <b>I've been on twitter just short of three years.</b><br /><br />Most of the people I added back then that still use twitter I consider friends now. Which is odd because I've only met one (that'd be @brad). When I mention them offline I usually refer to them as an "acquaintance", but the reality is that I've done considerably more with them than I've done with my apartment neighbors. <br /><br />And we really are close. While we have our own friends and acquaintances we operate as a circle. I follow @brad, @mykul, @j1, @phenobarb, @jessie and @fru--and they all follow each other. @gorgeoux follows @crystal, as do I, @j1 and @jessie. @brad and I follow @super_mandy who was more a part of the crew when she was @jetpackjane. #fixreplies was made for people like us.<br /><br />The problem, however, is that it's not the same twitter. the web app has gone novel, then kinda broke, then got fixed, then blew up, and now I'm not really sure what it is. <b>It's a lot more about "What are you doing?" but less from the relationship perspective and more towards the whole social branding perspective.</b> Which really makes everything feel a lot like high school, fighting for popularity and wondering if you're cool enough.<br /><br /><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="tweet_friends.jpg" src="http://www.leftsider.com/images/tweet_friends.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" height="95" width="497" /></span>Nostalgia is never progressive, so I'll look forward to Twitter's next iteration and be the first to board that ship when it arrives. I'm just glad I was able to make friends here when it was possible to do so.<br /><br /><br /><br /> <div><br /></div>

BODY:
<p>What will you tell your children to be when they grow up?</p>
<p>When I was a child, I often heard that I could be anything that I wanted, but in my mind I always hear the same occupations: doctor, lawyer. As an adult I generalize doctors as often unhappy, overworked, and not passion-driven. Lawyers I equate to low ethics,&nbsp;licentious lifestyles and paying your dues--forever. I'm not sure I'd push my child to be either, though they should do whatever they set their minds to.</p>
<p>Why would people tell their kids to be doctors and lawyers? They make a lot of money, yes. But was there anything more? I like to imagine that the original incentive was the ability to do something desperately needed and in short supply. This guaranteed perpetual demand, unlike the&nbsp;factory and machine-based&nbsp;that perhaps was the norm of that period. Looking back even further, perhaps one encouraged their child to be a metal worker rather that worry after the finicky harvest of farming and animal husbandry.</p>
<p>Today, however, there are tons of doctors, and even more lawyers. I wouldn't go so far as to say that there is no longer a demand for these fields, but the return is not as guaranteed as it was even a decade ago, let alone a generation. </p>
<p>The thing most concerning, however, is that these jobs are information based. It is the information that the doctor, the lawyer, the MBA gained through years of study that made them valued. It was the checks and balances of their peers that made them trustworthy, and it was the relatively high cost to order this information that kept them well. In today's era, where information is much easier to sort, qualify and transfer, where records are available both as reputation and as precedent, and access becomes pervasive, I wonder whether the bell tolls for the mediocre of the craft (in much the same way that it has for the mediocre journalist, the mediocre print designer, and so many others).</p>
<p>The same with going to college. It was a certain advantage that clearly set one apart; now, it is basically expected that all high school graduates should go.</p>
<p>Should I tell my kid just to get into computers? What if software and hardware development and maintenance become the equivalent of writing recipies and changing oil? Sure, there will always be some people who need it, but mainly because they have chosen not to learn the ability themselves.</p>
<p>Perhaps I'll tell my little one to learn to see what it is people need. If they can provide that--even if it means several different careers over a lifetime--they will have an adaptive security that should weather any economic or technological&nbsp;climate.</p>
<p>There is a word of caution in this; I am telling myself not to be comfortable in the status of a position. Needs ebb and wane, and only those able to stay afloat avoid being pulled under. Trust demand rather than norms, and even if you're overly cautious, you'll always be relatively safe.</p>

Is there anything wrong with encouraging a child to do for self? Sure you can follow crowd needs and stay in demand--but what is to be said for learning to provide for self independent of societal demand? 

Certainly the farmer can live most consistently despite external fluctuation--his food and his work are tied to him; only when he relies upon selling to generate income does he become linked. Are there modern, non-agricultural professions that have this same autonomy?

<p>Legs. Legging-clad legs, to be precise. Apparently the fashion trend this season for women is black tights with either a really long shirt or a really short skirt or shorts. Because of my fondness for the innocent naivete of the culture, I looked with concern upon this new development.</p>

<p>Imagine, then, my initial reaction to This soju commercial: </p>

EXTENDED BODY:
<p><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5R5yYmeqqS4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/5R5yYmeqqS4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="344" width="425"></object></p>

<p>The starlet's face looks a bit young to be peddling liquor, and her body is pumping a bit much to match her innocent face. Fru actually asked if it was the same girl when I showed her the commercial, while I ranted about <a href="http://jezebel.com/5392647/underage-stars-is-there-a-sexual-double-standard-hell-yeah">irresponsible pop influences and trends embraced without deliberation upon long-term societal impressions</a>.</p>

<p>But then I had several conversations where women of this society spoke candidly of a man's tendency toward these things. I'm not going to talk about the silent allowance of certain behaviors, yet the discussion of these topics did not dawdle in what was right and what was wrong. It exists--literally 있다, a verb so common in Korea--perhaps explaining the viewpoint. These women felt its existence was not influenced, it would seem, by calling it good or evil.</p>

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/images/wp_yuko01.jpg"><img alt="wp_yuko01.jpg" src="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/assets_c/2009/11/wp_yuko01-thumb-400x561-2.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: center; display: block;" height="561" width="400" /></a></span><p>On the flight back we perused a Narita airport bookstore. Now Japan is a haven for skin mags, be it the hard stuff that can barely be called porn or the light publications of "gravure idols," bikini clad on a beach or in a maid outfit in a house somewhere. Still, I was shocked when (a totally startled) Fru showed me what looked to be few different <b>teen magazines</b>--which had, nestled in their center, a half-dozen or so pages of photo-fueled sex tips and other definitely not US-kosher unwrapped airport material.</p>

<p>How bad are Korea's sexy girls groups when Japan is showing sex to youth like fashion fads? If the entire society considers something ok, is it still wrong? Religion aside, of course; not everyone exists in the same religious society. Somthing to ponder as Asia is revealed to the world--and vice-versa.</p>

The Sistine Chapel, Leonardo's sketches, Hokusai's wave--all use the same tool: the stroke. <br /></p>

<p>This is important for many reasons, but I feel the greatest is this: if knowledge of the tool expands the ability in a craft <a href="http://www.designsojourn.com/truths-about-creativity/">there is nothing inborn about creativity</a>. It is merely seeing something to its logical end which allows for what we consider to be the greatest works.</p><br />
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>In an interview on Charlie Rose, Malcolm Gladwell asserted that it
is perseverance and stubborn diligence which creates a master. If I
remember correctly he said that it's usually at the 10-year mark that
those we deem great will look back and say, "here's where it started to
feel natural; here's where I found myself completely comfortable within
my craft." </p>

<p>So it would seem that, yes, <a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/10/how-creativity-is-killing-the.html">we are not all creative</a>... but simply because
we haven't put in the time. <br /></p><p>Additionally, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html">school programs deem the arts and such
mind-expanding activities as less than necessary</a>, and we accept it. The
societal consensus tells us that it takes a dream and a lucky break to
be successful creatives, and (why? for the life of me <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/possible-titles-for-bravos-new-reality-shows,33604/">I don't know</a>) we believe it. I wonder what would happen
if we revised the default value and process for being creative. What
would we see in a century, even a generation.</p>

<p>I imagine we'd first see that being creative is not about using
colors or notes; it's about creating things. "Creating things" should
imply that what is created <i>was not</i>; "reinvention" is a horrible word that
confuses what really is happening. </p>

<p>What most often happens in our world is <b><i>design</i></b>, and design always
answers a question. Often times that question is very specific, but in
reality it usually always comes down to "what will make this better?" <br /></p><p>An artist creates, and as the creator is given the ultimate authority
as to what his creation means, what it is saying. A designer will
forever be bound to the definition of efficiency and improvement, and
should never be in a position to define their own work. They may state
what it does, but in truth that should be evident in the work itself
and by those who utilize it.</p><p>Which brings us full circle: it is the arrangement of strokes--its design, if you will--that makes us immediately tell a masterpiece from an amateurish rendering. And that design is the product of dedicated persistence; not whim. How many strokes came from Van Gogh's brush before "Starry Night"? Which stroke did not hone his ability to the level of that now-famous work?</p><p>How many strokes are between you and your goal?<br /></p><p><br /></p>

He was a nice old man who always told me, "your teeth are great. Besides braces I can't recommend anything." So I was happy.<br /><br />When I was in high school, I chipped one of my bottom teeth. He said, "don't worry about it; it's small enough that it'll file down over time anyway." I trusted him. My teeth were great.<br /><br />I was here in the MD/DC area and would drive 90 miles to go to this dentist who had serviced my teeth since I had them. One visit he looked at my mouth and made this "Psshh!" sound like he was looking at a total wreck not worth bothering over. And then I realized that this jerk was an old dentist just waiting for retirement and not wanting to bother with my teeth because it wouldn't matter to him anyway.<br /><br />I stopped going to the dentist.<br /><br /><br />

EXTENDED BODY:
I moved to Korea and was unsure if dentistry there was something I
wanted to try. So essentially about three years passed without even a
cleaning. When I got back to the states (and my insurance kicked in) I
asked a coworker and she recommended her dentist. I set an appointment.<br /><br />Instead
of getting her dentist, Dr. A, I was scheduled with his partner. Dr. K,
who was awesome. Young, nice personality, good sense of humor; his
dental assistant was also great. What I liked most, though, is that he
took the time to explain things, then explain the process, then ask me
what I wanted to do. It was always my choice, and he went to great
lengths to identify all possible scenarios. Ultimately I felt he was
being completely honest and I could rely on his judgment. <br /><br />That
lasted about three visits. The next time I came, he was out of town.
The hygienist changed as well, and she was tearing the crap out of my
gums. Then I come back and they say his wife had a kid so he wanted to
work less (blah blah blah) basically he wasn't there anymore. <br /><br />Dr.
A wasn't bad, so I stuck around. But as time has progressed, I've
become less confident in his work. Each visit I feel like there's less
of a plan and more of a fix going on. To the point where I've been <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/6546111/Pessimists-more-likely-to-avoid-going-to-the-dentist.html">putting off fixing things that should be fixed</a>.<br /><br />So
today I finally called the dental office that's located in my apartment
building, of all places. We'll see how it goes. I feel bad slinking
behind my dentist's back (and hygienist #4, who actually is pretty
cool) but I have this sneaking suspicion I should expect more. I'm just
not sure what I should be expecting. Should I be at one of these
newfangled "dental spas"? Or is my lot to simply accept whatever
mediocrity providence sends my way?<br /><br />Something tells me there's more to dental service than just "grin and bear it."<br />

So it turns out what seemed to be a tiny mask for a tax cover-up (no windows, no traffic, no website) turned out to be the back door (not the front entrance) for a reasonably nice dental clinic! The dentist was good-natured, very inquisitive, and took the time to explain to me everything that she was thinking as she assessed my situation.

Bonus points that she managed to convince me of her credibility through many points including complementing some of the work that Dr. A did.

All said, since it takes me less than two minutes to be back in my house, I'll probably stick with her. Plus, the woman who I think would be the hygienist is could be Kim Kardashian's older sister! *meow* ^^

It's really quite exciting to see the issue of race in Korea getting an international platform like FP. It's really hard to explain to non-Koreans how bad it can be for bi-racial or foreign kids growing up in Korea--but it's especially hard to explain to Koreans how this "pure race" mentality is completely and totally unacceptable outside their world. With the help of stories like these, perhaps things can change.

* "It is rare for a man to miss the mark through holding on to essentials."

I think more people should stop making Confucius Jokes and start actually reading Confucius.

I keep hearing this ideology around the blogosphere, and I keep agreeing with it, but man is it difficult to do. I have no trouble betting my income on my results; betting it against vindictive enemies is a different undertaking all together.

I imagine most people who practice this most effectively are those who work for themselves or as the head of what they do. Which comes first (the behavior or the position) I'll leave you to ponder.

<p>Admit it--there are so many things we do that are completely and truly hollow fronts to portray something that we are not. We put on <s>nooses</s> ties, we user our blinker when a cop is nearby, we call out ideologies and mantras on twitter and like things we don't care about on facebook.</p>

<p>Maybe I've taken influence from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Watchmen#The_Comedian_.28Edward_Morgan_Blake.29">The Comedian</a>, who saw life's hypocrisy and wore it out for all to see.

Several things here:

* the suggestion (threat?) of someone that they may get married soon
* the arrival of a ring on the finger of another someone
* the silent removal of an engagement ring on the finger of a third

Well, I can't be more excited than I feel. If someone were to actually ask, "Bryan, how do you feel about this?" I'd say, "Meh."

**Marriage is overblown.** Trust me; I'm a happily married guy, and I know from experience. Allow me to explain.
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
The experience I've had has been one I'd never change, and I hope lasts my lifetime. Fru is all the good things in me, and without her I question their existence. We've been together for over a decade, so the possibility of having a live devoid of her is hard for the imagination to conjure.

That said, two months after we were married we moved to the other side of the globe. A dozen time zones and thousands of miles away from any kind of support, we were forced to rely on each other--which, of course, is what we promised to do in our vows. When we returned a year later, we were inseparable.

**I think that, given the right intentions, and the right environment, any partnership can last a lifetime.** There is nothing fantastical about marriage that makes this happen, for it is only the two people joined can make a marriage work. Those two people can make it work without a marriage license, and often I think those who try that often turn out as good or better.

<div class="zemanta-img mt-image-right" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; display: block; float: right; width: 310px; "><a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Isra%C3%ABls-A_Jewish_Wedding-1903.jpg"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Isra%C3%ABls-A_Jewish_Wedding-1903.jpg/300px-Isra%C3%ABls-A_Jewish_Wedding-1903.jpg" alt="A Jewish Wedding" width="300" height="280"></a><p class="zemanta-img-attribution" style="font-size:0.8em">Image via <a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Isra%C3%ABls-A_Jewish_Wedding-1903.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p></div>**So why do we get married? I propose two reasons:** societal expectations and religious adherence. We have been trained into thinking that marriage is what two people who love each other do, and also that marriage is a way of saying that we love each other. We also throw around religious tenets and verbiage that an overwhelming majority of the religious--let alone humanity--rarely adheres to. It's all a part of our culture; the myths and symbols that give us boundaries in our living.

So, as I told the person threatening to marry: if that's what you're wanting to do, fine. But do it for the two of you--not for your parents, or for your social circle, or because you're getting older, or because all your friends already have or any other reason. If you're already sleeping together (or even living together) and your life is decidedly secular, marriage is not the reason nor the way to introduce religious tradition to your relationship. Fight the pressure and be happy; it'd be better to live a happy life of questionable morals than to suffer under rules you never truly committed to. **I'll say it again: I'd rather my daughter live with her lover and be happy all her life than to marry for my sake and be miserable--"just ok," even.**

I'd love for all people to feel the relationship more important than the marriage. To the person whose engagement ring silently disappeared: I am more concerned about your feelings and well-being in the loss of a relationship than I am the cancellation of your wedding. *You* are what matters most. I find it a travesty that broken hearts must hide from public exposure when they most need support and reinforcement.

**Finally, to those who have gotten their hearts aligned:** *congratulations.* Continue in the path that you've started: building, and growing, and loving. A medical journey does not end with an M.D., and your journey is nowhere near complete with a wedding. Treat your wedding as "day 0" of the real thing, and you'll help yourself when you're faced with learning experiences later on.

Marriage is overblown. It's being with the one you love for the rest of your life that's awesome.

Now that I've bored you with my attempt at eloquence, something totally different (but important!):

This dude may or may not be the first boss I had in this building, just about a decade ago. Outside of the usual banter, we happened across an interesting discussion.</p>

<p><b>What life experience do you look back upon that signaled your transition from childhood into adulthood?</b></p>

<p>He asked me if turning 30 was hard, and I said no. I've always sorta felt like an old man anyways, so every year I become more comfortable and at peace with self. He found that interesting, so he told this story (I'm paraphrasing):</p>

<blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><p><i>I grew up in Florida, and where I lived was near this canal--called </i><a href="http://wikimapia.org/#lat=25.900017&amp;lon=-80.123441&amp;z=15&amp;l=0&amp;m=s&amp;v=9"><i>Haulover Cut</i></a><i>--that connected the bay and the ocean [...] </i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Road_A1A_%28Florida%29"><i>there's a bridge</i></a><i> there where people committed suicide--we used to jump off that thing for fun!--and we'd fish and swim there when I was a kid... I'm sure it's changed a lot </i><a href="http://www.pbase.com/image/77183370"><i>since then</i></a><i> but anyway... If you swam out of the canal a bit the ocean current would catch you pull you out [...] so we'd swim parallel to the current and got out on the shoreline a ways down and make your way back up.</i></p><p><i>[...] I remember I was just about to go to junior college, I had gotten a job working at the local paper. I drove over and put on my snorkel and fins [...] I swam out and the current took me and I just cruised along--you didn't even need to swim the current was so strong--over the rocks and around the jetty until I got onto the shore, took my gear off, walked back, and did it a couple more times. Then I threw my gear into the car and left; but for some reason, </i><b><i>after all these years, I still look back at that as maybe my last childhood action.</i></b><i> After that I went to work, went to school, did other grownup stuff. But I always think back to that as my last childhood experience.</i></p></blockquote>

It's all over now, but there are many questions that remain:

* **Road Protocol:** What is the method for choosing which roads get attention first?
* **Pedestrian Value:** Obviously the suburbs don't care for pedestrian travel, but in the tighter, urban, walkable areas... what happens to sidewalks, paths and trails in a snowstorm? It would seem the sidewalks connected to condominiums were the only ones that were maintained in Bethesda (outside of the shopping district).
* **Schnowdenfreude:** Is there any level of pleasure/sadness gained by snow removal personnel from their job? What about when their work assists/undoes the work of others? What about instances when [someone's inactivity prevents them from a complete job](http://yfrog.com/4fdp4nj)?
* **Where does it go?** Last night a dozen dump trucks were loaded with removed snow... where does all that white stuff go?
* **Moving Glaciers:** What is the mindset of the person who cleans their car off completely? The person who leaves a huge mound of snow on their roof?

Even in the most mundane things, we can discover so much about a culture, a person, a way of thinking. So before you think this post completely useless: what question above would not be useful to improving user experience--not just in product design but specifically in website/interface improvement and application development?

Going downtown tonight it seems sidewalks got much better treatment. Perhaps Bethesda is not as committed to walkability as they've presented ([walkscore.com](http://www.walkscore.com) gives us a 92 out of 100).

Another comment: Apparently [a cop drew a gun](http://bit.ly/8w4aDU) on a huge snowball fight that took over 14th and U this weekend. What was the psychology behind *that* snow management?

BODY:
All my life, I've been sensitive to how people perceive me. In fact, much of my personality can be attributed to one habit I've had as long as I remember: wondering [what other people saw when they looked at me](http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200908/mixed-signals).

My self-esteem has been completely built on the success of this calculated presentation. And while everyone makes a few false judgments on how they are viewed, In general I've found myself happy with the consistency I've had at providing others with what manifestation of me works best for them.

2009 sent me reeling from some pretty heavy blows regarding my public image, and ultimately I have come to question who in this world is worthy of my trust--myself included. Am I really all that I present myself to be? Are the opinions of others really who I am? Where does [opinion become fact](http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/12/online-identity1.html), and how does objectivity apply in something as subjective as self?

As a result, I am seriously considering generating a separate method for receiving input about myself, in the hopes that it will reinforce or call into question my existing system of evaluation. If that works well, it could prevent some of the nasty blindesides I've gotten in the past year or so.

To be honest, I am coming to terms with who I am. I am smart, but I am slow; I am insightful yet forgetful, and I'm an open-minded skeptic. I think these traits, when recognized, become some of my most defining features. I hope to build my future improving myself based on external data rather than placate the world with a popular mask.

How do you go about auditing your street cred? What tools or activities give you insight to your public reptutation?

I think, like [Jodi](http://eastwestpage.wordpress.com/), my initial feeling about this is "yet another nutjob... and why is the media making note of this?"

But by removing the religious extremist element from the picture, I find myself really admiring this guy's courage and willingness to sacrifice himself for change--something that [I've written about before](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2009/02/protest-in-the-age-of-detached.html). His action, in this light, is the epitome of true protest.

**So here's something to ponder:** *How many Korean Americans (nutjob or otherwise) would it take to do this before it influenced the situation in any way whatsoever?* How many Korean Americans would need to go before it was picked up (and most likely supported) by those protest-loving South Korean activists? How many South Korean and Korean American activists would it take before North Korea was forced to respond--even if the US or South Korea did not?

These are very well-designed, handcrafted wooden toys by Josh Finkle. **They are very cute, but there's one problem:** they are caricatures of recently extinct animals.

There are obvious reasons that I think he explains rather well as to why these are chosen. I can't help but wonder though, about their end result--will they lead me to a higher awareness to the fragility of nature... or will I eagerly await the next set of dead species turned in to cute lovable playthings?

As the new year came around, I decided to do something about it. I started a facebook event under my B.A.S.T.I.O.N. group called <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=224622212983">B.A.S.T.I.O.N F.I.T.</a> (Fitness in 2010).<p></p>

<p>The problem with getting more active is that it really works best when you're doing it with others. Coincidentally, no one wants to commit to something like that. Still, the peer support can do wonders, so with this event you can choose your own goals and method (or select from one of the methods listed) and just use the event as a means of support. </p>

<p>Surprisingly, over 20 people immediately signed up. It seems I'm the only one posting regularly, but it was nice to see others with a similar interest.</p>

<p>I'm working up my stamina, so I'm starting with running and hoping to be at a level where I can do <a href="http://texafornia.squarespace.com/home/2009/2/13/the-push-running-secret-revealed-p90x-prep-done-easy.html">ZenTri's P90x prep</a> pretty regularly. It's a little bit harder than I expected. I'm way out of shape. Started feeling awkwardness in my legs, so I <a href="http://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/7490907021">asked a twitter friend</a> who happens to be a triathlete. He said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Likely connective tissue tears--where tendon meets bone. If [you] haven't been running, connective tissue [becomes] weak. Muscle pulls away from bone. Light leg circuit weight training at gym (12-15 reps) will strengthen ligament/bone connection."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it looks like I'll possibly be doing more than just running to get fit. Looking forward to the energy boost <a href="http://twitter.com/ZenTriathlon">@ZenTriathlon</a> promises--and looking forward to being fit and firm when the weather gets warm!</p>

One of the more interesting dynamics of humanity lies within the concept of charity. I have three points that should influence our thinking in giving aid to Haiti.

**Charity is defined as the voluntary giving of help, but in modern practice there is rarely an offer of assistance without motive or expectation.** How many hot meals, for example, would you hand out in your neighborhood if you knew that half the recipients would drop the meal on the ground and spit in your face? Despite the other appreciative half who would benefit, few would endure such disrespect.

It is also worth noting that **there are no intrinsic guarantees our charity will be used as anticipated or received at all**. From the [Korean peninsula](http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-institutions_government/korea_aid_4588.jsp) to the [Middle East](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan#Foreign_involvement_and_aid_to_the_mujahideen) region to the [African continent](http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2370672/Clothing-donations-bypass-the-needy.html) we see examples of this.

Finally, **it is naive to offer charity without understanding the recipient's perception of the giver**. If your benefactor is also your oppressor, there's less appreciation. If your angel is in worse straits than you (like when North Korea offered aid to Katrina victims), there may be a devaluation of sincerity.

**So what does this all have to do with Haiti?** Just as much as it does with your reason for giving. You see stories and pictures of travesty and send money; meanwhile, people in the streets of Port-au-Prince yell, "[More doctors, fewer journalists!](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/01/15/2793719.htm?section=justin)" 

Consider the mix of emotions of a person whose family is lying dead on the street, who sleeps next to them because their house is no longer safe to inhabit. Consider them bathing in the streets in unclean water while you come by with big trucks and cameras. Perhaps you'd understand why they'd say "[Put down  the camera and help us.](http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1953379_1953494_1954327,00.html)"

Now consider that much of the international aid that is not given by NGOs is offered with considerable requirements--to ensure expectations and political motives are met. **This has NOTHING to do with helping people,** and is essentially the reason why Haiti as a nation is unable to respond to its own needs. I repeat: [Haiti is a result of foreign occupation and oppression by the same people who are providing aid right now.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jan/13/our-role-in-haitis-plight)

So when your country has been getting royally violated for the the last 70 years by foreign aid, how would you respond? If you [weren't an effective humanitarian](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2010/0114102wyclef1.html) but you knew people who were suffering--dying--what would you do?

<object height="295" width="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/lDE8YJac0Wc&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/lDE8YJac0Wc&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="295" width="480"></embed></object> /via [@jody_kiely](http://www.leftsider.com/jody_kiely)

Perhaps new thinking is required. Better yet: [new action](http://www.slate.com/id/2241861/?from=rss). And a much better understanding and implementation of charity--and reparation. Starting with our brothers and sisters in Haiti, let history be [consulted but not repeated](http://www.thenation.com/blogs/notion/517494/what_haiti_is_owed). Let's think [beyond what the pictures show us](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34900543/ns/world_news-haiti_earthquake/), and let us encourage and assist those who are seeking to commit their energies to improvement while we throw dollars and criticisms from the comfort of our [text messages and tweets](http://www.techstartups.com/2010/01/17/sms-money-will-get-to-haiti-eventually/).

**And by all means, keep giving.** Better yet: plan to visit Haiti later this year when the media has found something else to show and the country is till poor, still needing, still suffering (like it was before the quake). Show that your heart is connected to your hands and not just your wallet. And to your brain as well; generate awareness and be active in campaigns to forgive debts Haiti has with IMF, World Bank, IDB and others. These points should define our giving and caring as we look to Haiti

I'll be changing my usage of twitter. Again.

1. **Every twitter account I'm even remotely intrigued by, I will follow.** I am cultivating my own [public timeline](http://twitter.com/public_timeline). I want to expand what I hear from the twitter community from my own valuations (rather than external [suggestions](http://blog.twitter.com/2010/01/power-of-suggestions.html) or [trends](http://twittercism.com/local-trends/))
2. **I will use twitter's "lists" feature to focus on specific twitterers that, for [one reason](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2009/06/old-birds-new-tune.html) or another, catch my attention.** If anyone from twitter reads this, *it'd be a great feature to have the ability to select a "list" as your "home" page.* I want to easily cut the noise and receive the signal, making twitter *actually useful.*
3. **The "reply" feature will be deprecated.** If I need to reply to someone, it will be a complete tweet thought that can stand alone; otherwise, I'll defer to the "direct message" feature. I now think the twitter team had the right idea when they ["fixed replies"](http://mashable.com/2009/05/13/fixreplies/); without context, replies lose usefulness. Now that I stream my tweets on Leftsider, and [Google shows tweets in search results](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/rt-google-tweets-and-updates-and-search.html), my tweets are being asked to mature a bit.

As I have pretty much abandoned [twitter SMS usage](http://help.twitter.com/forums/59008/entries) (thanks, iPhone apps!), it no longer is important that I keep my following number low--especially since twitter now allows me to select which tweets to send. A lot of people who were snubbed or axed by my notorious "following 79" rule may find themselves back on board. This, I expect, will also affect my recent follower plateau.

From a few random strangers to *practically everyone I meet these days*, twitter certainly is a different animal. I'd be interested in knowing how other people are taming the beast.

As the snow falls this evening, I'm in my living room moving slowly. I'm slightly perspiring, my hands are in front of me; my weight is entirely on one foot. After a couple minutes, I shift slightly to the other foot and turn gently.

No, I'm not re-enacting *The Karate Kid*...

...but I am practicing a martial art. For about seven months I've been studying a Yang-style of Taijiquan (better known as Tai Chi) at [Great River Taoist Center](http://www.grtc.org) in downtown DC. I really like it, and I thought I'd explain why.

* **Taiji is a system. Like any system, there are parts--and these parts' value diminish when taken in isolation.** I found this out when I breifly became interested in yoga. Yoga is also a system developed by Hindu practitioners for greater control of the body--meditation's greatest distraction--not for health or fitness. You will not find this basis in most of the yoga studios you visit. Of all the people who I know who have practiced or are studying, only [one](http://twitter.com/crystal/status/8863344695) have I seen progress into the actual deeper application. Taiji was developed as a fighting style. There are poses or *forms*, that when given *application*, can be used in physical *engagement*(be it fixed routines or free sparring). Thus, practitioners gain mindfulness as well has heath and martial benefits. GRTC is the first place I've found of any such kind that presents a full system rather than the more popular (and profitable) packaged parts.

* **Taiji is slow and laborious. I am not a fast person, and I appreciate taking my time.** Everyone wants to be great, but very few care *how* they become great. People balk at the idea of dedicating extensive time to fully understanding something; it's much more common to hear "give me the basic points" than "let's cover each point in detail." Taijiquan's famous slow progression through forms is specifically to highlight every point, and to establish the structure that will support (later) fast movement. It also provides room for reflection, while the cyclical practices make review a norm. You will always learn something new, and you can always extend your understanding of even the most basic concepts. Taiji seems to be designed with this in mind (in fact, the center's director advocates giving a school "about 2 years" to see if its teachings are sound!). In this [streaming, always-on, multitasking world](http://www.businessinsider.com/fred-destin-available-2010-2), taijiquan brings repose without inactivity. I have no goal to make, no record to beat; only myself to improve--and all the time in the world.

* **Taijiquan avoids a focus on strength, instead embracing right intent and application.** I grew up in a relatively rural, where strong guys abound. But unlike the swollen gym rats that scurry around DC streets, most of these guys are not huge. They know how to correctly apply their strength, and this does not require obscene bulges. Taiji emphasizes proper structure over big muscles--the center's favorite phrase is "steel wrapped in cotton"--which makes it accessible to all sizes, ages and genders. It also makes note of key areas in application which make less effort work more.

<ul class="action-stream-list"><li class="service-icon service-twitter"><span class="entry-content">Leftsider <a href="http://twitter.com/Leftsider/statuses/9108098352">tweeted</a>, "At Original Pancake House with James and Nerise. Apparently, Aussies eat pancakes with ice cream and maple syrup! <a href="http://yfrog.com/3lycxmj">http://yfrog.com/3lycxmj</a>"</span></li></ul><br/><br/>

**Not only do they regularly eat pancakes with ice cream,** they do so regularly at a place around Sydney called [Pancakes on the Rocks](http://bit.ly/dvvOa8). Additionally, they consider this *"a very American thing to do."* Fru and I watched in amazement as Nerise poured a polite amount of maple syrup over her special plate.

<a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/images/ycxm.jpeg"><img alt="Nerise's Pancakes" src="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/assets_c/2010/02/ycxm-thumb-500x375-22.jpeg" width="500" height="375" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a>

The plate was only partially special because of its unusualness--the waitress told us of a regular customer that was fond of ice cream on pancakes. What made this plate special was it was the last dish on the table--and when we looked into its absence we discovered that a member of the kitchen staff had *run to a nearby grocery* to fulfill our order.

When the waitress heard us mention the oddity of ice cream on pancakes and shared her experience of other customers, she also saw the slight disappointment in Nerise's face that this was not to be expected. **So she took extra initiative to make her customer happy.** In fact, she praised James' choice of the nutella pancakes (her fav), got Nerise exactly what she wanted, accepted my credit card and brought back my receipt (this is a place that is strictly "pay as you exit") and wished us all a happy Valentine's Day with a smile.

*Customer service is about making people happy, as much as is eating waffles and pancakes at Sunday brunch.* Growing up, pancakes were homemade Sunday food, and waffles were a rare occasion--generally where we found ourselves 20 miles away from home and my dad in a cheerful mood. So in many instances (especially when eating out), the **meal is also the pursuit of happiness**.

There are a few pancake establishments here on the east, the most famous being, of course, [IHOP](http://bit.ly/afjjun). It wasn't until middle school that I recognized the difference between them--and not until high school until I recognized the the southern stand-by that is [Waffle House](http://bit.ly/c40S5Z). But for me, apart from the great customer service received today at the location walking distance from my house, the best is and will always be the [Original Pancake House](http://bit.ly/97PvwG). It does it because of the pleasant atmosphere that accompanies the happy-making food.

I have this experience with another food establishment--[Silver Diner](http://bit.ly/bs1y1H). I didn't do diners until after high school, and the one all my friends frequented (and worked at) was SD. The fact that they did such a good job at a warm, clean, pleasant environment was driven home when I went to a more "authentic diner." I was afraid to pick up the menu, let a lone order from it.

**In all these things, there is a battle: the battle between *efficiency* and *luxury*. Do you focus on functionality or sensuality? Are we here just to survive or also to enjoy? And do these decisions stop at our personal experience or extend to the experiences we create in others?**

Swinging back to today's experience, today was Nerise's first day in America; she arrived last night from Australia where she and James live. I imagine it's nice to be completely catered to while stuffing your face on your idea of an american meal (whose portions are BIG, as you dreamed but didn't expect). 

Even James, who has been here on research since the beginning of the year, was impressed by the service--and happy to see his wife happy on her first day here. He's been *surviving* these past two months without struggle, but it's nice to *enjoy* a meal with one you love.

And for us: how do we know James? We sat next to him at our church one sabbath and discovered he was staying in our apartment building by himself--subleasing from a friend's friend, with no mobile phone, no tv and no acquaintances besides the people helping him in the lab. So for the past month or so, every weekend has included James as our special guest; this weekend we were happy to add Nerise as if she was as natural a part of our weekend as James has come to feel.

Because it's not just customer service: **life itself is about the pursuit of happiness--and the pursuit of happiness is predicated upon extending happiness into the life of others.** It is unfortunate that businesses have found this for profit purposes before we as a society have found it to our civic benefit.

I'm happy that my metropolitan area made second place in the level of well-bing US cities (cited in the article), but it is more interesting to see the correlation between specific things and feelings of well-being. For a measure of clarity (especially for those unaccustomed to looking at charts of this type) it would have been nice to see a few areas that were considered (or discovered) to be non-essential to metropolitan well being.

Saying "I told you so" doesn't make the tremendous drop in Haiti coverage any less depressing. I'm appreciative that there are still many relief efforts and humanitarian aid providers on the scene, yet I cringe at the thought that **Haiti was in our prayers only as long as it was before our eyes.**

With the torrential storm season fast approaching, and *tens of thousands still living outside*, I fear the worst is not yet over for this impoverished nation.

Possibly wondered why I didn't make any sort of big announcement here or on Twitter noting the transition or detailing the process.

The reason, reader, is because I don't like the site. there's about 10-15% of me that is bitter because I recommended and started development on a different version. The other 85-90% of me is bitter because the new style, which is nice, took over a year to move from concept to deliverable, and the deliverable was so poorly done...

Getting things up to snuff was hard, but I found reward in the way a few teammates went above and beyond the usual workload to see this thing go live (probably because they were as tired of it as I was). It was the first time I felt a sense of team on a web project in the 18 months I've been here, and it felt so good..

<img alt="firethedesigner.jpg" src="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/images/firethedesigner.jpg" width="500" height="339" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" />

ANN's new design still has a ton of issues, enough that I'm fixing and releasing them en masse like a version release. We're actually calling it "ANN 2.1" and it will largely be an optimization of code and css. We'll also push the release more appropriate of an Movable Type-powered site--as a template set.

Rather than risking an visible issue as we "upgrade" the design, I thought it'd be nice to stage the entire site on a developmental server and test things first. Problem is, I didn't have a server environment that matched precisely; ideally it'd be best to mirror the old site, make the changes, and then point the domain to the improved version. So I asked my IT department for a new virtual server.

They kindly obliged earlier this month, and once I got things squared away with the template set, I set out building the server to specifications. One thing I can say about this job: it has broadened my understanding of server administration and Apache configuration. Playing around in a fresh server, googling solutions, and discovering through error is a great way to learn little things you never realized. I'm officially a terminal man now. :)

With nothing really set up as far as web strategy, design process, or even mac hardware tech support for my department, life has been one big problem after another. But now that I'm nearing the end of the worst of it, I'm finding myself more capable and more confident about the methods and systems I came with. Soon, I'll be able to push forward with a more visible manner--one that I'll be proud of.

There's a lot involved in that change, and it's something deliberate that I'm doing rather than something *environmental*. It's been a long time coming but the momentum is building.

It started with the harsh reality of deception by nearly every person I know. Even today my mind boggles at the expanse of friends, colleagues, and loved ones who seemingly lied to my face day in and day out. Not that they lied; they just didn't tell me the truth--and that really hurt me to my core.

I hated the world. What few reasons I had to live a life of goodness and civility were enshrouded by a thick, dark, desire to reject everything and ooze my brooding spirit throughout my world through base and carnal, vindictive machinations.

After a few months the darkness tempered. I decided that when I cut my hair I would die--to be reborn as a new person, one who was not fond of the original man or his vulnerabilities or his well-meaning friends. One who did as he felt and pulled no punches. Unfortunately, old habits die hard, and I lacked the reserve to be as badass as I had hoped.

Yet the process has begun, and as we approached 2010 I became increasingly determined to focus my frustrations, forging a new character. A new year, a new decade, and having just passed thirty, I wanted to make the alignment of these new milestones count. Today, I am truly different--though not yet fully adapted--and I feel a much heavier, more intense focus on things.

Many people around me don't like when I get too serious. They are accustomed to the easy-going, carefree, fun-loving person that I was. I still love fun, and I am not fast-paced, but life is too short and this world to complicated to not establish a bubble of cognizance in this sea of oblivion. 

So the "honesty, craftsmanship, good intent" motto I've assigned for this year is a very deceptive one. It is a waypoint between the man I was and the man I want to be. It shows the dreams and ideals mixed like blood and water with reality and end results. 

I no longer live in a dreamworld. My life is what I make it. Though life can be brutal, I refuse to return in kind. That is the kind of man I am.

Just spent a generous amount of time pouring through [Sartorialist](http://thesartorialist.blogspot.com/) archives for the entry that showed the fashion transition of this guy. His name is Kevin Stewart, and at the time he was first featured on the blog he was style director for Essence. I believe he now works in the same capacity for Mens' Fitness and ESPN.

I often think about [that blog entry](http://thesartorialist.blogspot.com/2008/07/when-first-we-metpart-2.html) when I think about growing out of familiar things and into new territory. As a result, Mr. Stewart has become something of an icon for me, a bold representation of bold moves.

He's [not the only one](http://thesartorialist.blogspot.com/2007/08/after-one-year-in-new-york-kara.html) whose transformations were chronicled in the Sartorialist, and i'm hope there will be many, many more. Ask yourself this question: how much change has come to your life via your own hand? Would someone look at you today and wonder how you came so far from yesterday?

I woke up this morning to the sound of my phone buzzing. It's the office; 10am is a reasonable time to call in DC, but it's 7am here. I take the call anyway. 

I lay in bed enjoying doing absolutely nothing. My room is awesome; being cooped up here for two days has been a joy. Finally at 8am I get up and take a shower as the huge tub fills. Hot soak for twenty minutes or so... bliss.

After the second shower I don a bathrobe and call for room service. The tray arrives as I'm dressing: muffin, danish, croissant, orange juice and peppermint tea. Read the USA Today as I munch. My head perspires slightly, still reeling from the soak.

The music from my iphone (connected to the alarm clock/ipod dock) shifts from languid to peppy. I empty the drawers of my clothes, throw away excess paper, pack and write this post. Soon it will be off to the airport and back to the pamper-free grind.

Thanks, Vegas, just for this morning. I hope things that happen like this don't stay here, but if it does I'll definitely be back.

We were classmates and good friends my junior year of academy. I hadn't seen him since that year. We talked a lot about old times (catching him up on what people from high school I still new of) and our current lives. He told me he worked for an [NGO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization) and promised that at some point he'd visit us in the US this year. When I came back, I was sure to tell my old friend Al[ex]. 

I met Al first, and started hanging out in his dorm room where he, his roommate also named Alex, and Kyung stayed up until the wee hours of the morning hatching nefarious plans. The room of the two Alexes had a steady flow of colorful characters of whom I became a regular member. When Kyung left our academy we quickly lost touch with him and only our memories kept him a part of our lives (even until very recently--Al asked me to see if I could find Kyung-hoo when we [moved to Korea](http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/sets/72157603654876387/) in 2004). Naturally, he was ecstatic to hear the news, as Al and Kyung were best buds that were nearly inseparable.

<a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/images/kyung_alex.jpg"><img alt="kyung_alex.jpg" src="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/assets_c/2010/04/kyung_alex-thumb-400x363-36.jpg" width="400" height="363" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a>

A few weeks ago I had a "[Coming to America](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094898/mediaindex)" -themed birthday party. When I announced the event on Facebook, Kyung-hoo chimed in that he might be able to attend if we postponed a bit; he was working in Haiti and wanted to drop in and visit us on his way back to Korea. The party went on as planned, but we set up plans for him to come stay with us for a bit.

Well things got complicated and U.S. customs had their way with him and he missed his flight--ending up in Pittsburgh yesterday morning with little more than 24 hours before his flight to Seoul. He called me before catching a Greyhound to D.C., And I immediately texted Al, who also works in the D.C. area.

Several hours later, two best friends who hadn't seen each other in roughly 15 years were back together:

<a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/images/photo%20%281%29.jpg"><img alt="photo (1).jpg" src="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/assets_c/2010/04/photo (1)-thumb-400x300-37.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a>

Of course there was a lot of getting up to speed involved, but soon enough things were starting to click. What really made it gel was when Alex showed up and completed the team:

<a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/images/photo%20%282%29.jpg"><img alt="photo (2).jpg" src="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/assets_c/2010/04/photo (2)-thumb-400x300-40.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a>

At this point Fru headed back to the house and the four of us roamed the streets of Bethesda like we had never been apart. We talked business, politics, religion, morality, girls, drugs, cars, plans, dreams and so many other things that it was no surprise we ended at my apartment around one in the morning. To be sure everything was covered, Al, Kyung and I then pulled out two yearbooks and scanned every page for stories, memories and updates. Finally after two we all passed out. 

After breakfast, I dropped Kyung-hoo off at the airport. He's going to South Korea for two weeks--to tell his family that he's accepted an assignment in Haiti for the next three years and to train his replacement. Then it's back to Port-au-Prince, where he'll build the house he'll live in. He says he'd be back to visit us every chance he gets.

When I got back home this afternoon, there was a pang in my heart similar to one felt last October; the feeling that something valuable I had lost had returned--only to be lost again. In october it was the feeling of home found with the people and places in Korea; this time it was my first successes with camaraderie. Both propel me forward with renewed intentions to do better at connecting with the past and incentive to look to a bright future.

<a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/images/photo%20%283%29.jpg"><img alt="photo (3).jpg" src="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/assets_c/2010/04/photo (3)-thumb-400x300-42.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a>

BODY:
Taking Kyung to the airport [yesterday](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2010/04/new-friendships-old-friends.html), I said a lot of things that I figured I should write down. He tends to ask me questions that really get me to the core of my philosophies, and I don't think I've ever written about my job's relation to my personal interests, though many have asked.

For nearly two years I've worked as assistant communication director and web manager at the world headquarters of the [Seventh-day Adventist Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church). Yes, I am an Adventist, and this makes it a no brainer as far as my faith (and the faith of 16 million others in over 200 countries) go. Still, there's more to it than that.

After returning to the US in 2006, I realized my vocation: [studying the relation between culture and technology](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/05/now-that-the-semester-is.html). I believe we are in a momentous era where humanity is no longer required to adapt to technological conventions--for the first time in history cultural conventions can dictate technological interactions without compromise. As a result, understanding people's values, beliefs, fears and concerns has never been more important.

Working in my position gives me access to a very large and very diverse community bound together by very specific beliefs. How can technology serve them? How can technology bolster (or even expand) their spirituality?

To answer that question, I first must define two terms: *spirituality* and *religion*. I take most of my academic understanding of these two terms from David Fontana's "[Psychology, Religion and Spirituality](http://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Religion-Spirituality-David-Fontana/dp/1405108061/)," which uses the following descriptions:

* **spirituality**: belief in another reality that can, through interaction or awareness, improve our existence in this reality.
* **religion**: a system of beliefs, practices and rituals directed towards the interaction or awareness.

While we're at it, we should go ahead and define **faith**, which is an unusually firm form of belief based on various teachings and observations which seem conclusive to the individual. As a result, a person's convictions generate both faith in a type of spirituality as well as the construct of interaction--the "religion," as it were.

This is important for a couple reasons. First, it allows for the whole lame argument, "I'm spiritual, but not religious" to persist as valid. Unfortunately, it does not make the person claiming this any less lame; If you believe that there is a reason to experience a greater reality but have not attempted development of a system for interaction, you are pitiful in every sense of the word precisely because of the second reason--all who attempt a link with the unknown require religion (as described by the definition above).

The sticking point is not that religion is unnecessary, but whether *corporate religion* is necessary. Quoting Fontana, 

> > *Religion has been on of the major formative influences upon human thought 
> > and behavior throughout the centuries. It has had a profound effect upon 
> > the lives of individuals, and upon groups and cultures. [...] However, religion 
> > has also had a negative side, serving during various periods of history as 
> > an ultra-conservative and repressive influence upon scientific development and 
> > upon the freedom of thought and speech. It has led to social and cultural 
> > divisions, and been the excuse for some of the most barbaric wars in history.*

If you happen to be the type of person who likes books like [Clay Shirky's](http://shirky.com/) "[Here Comes Everybody](http://www.amazon.com/Here-Comes-Everybody-Organizing-Organizations/dp/0143114948/)" or Brafman and Beckstrom's "[The Starfish and the Spider](http://www.amazon.com/Starfish-Spider-Unstoppable-Leaderless-Organizations/dp/1591841836)" you'll immediately see the potential for technology to help "unstick" this issue. Since the advent of the printing press--and increasingly ever since--people have had less incentive to rely on corporate organization to provide the conviction that creates faith.

Could this mean the death of corporate religion? [A resounding yes](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2009/05/the-biggest-problem-with-relig.html); one which I wonder if leaders of world religions have actually discerned. Does this mean the end of organized religion? It does not have to. I believe if there is value to participating in something, participation will persist as long as value is retained. There may no longer be an interest in a large entity to tell you what to believe, but there will always be a desire to find and be a part of a community of like-minded individuals. 

To that end, I find it a very exciting and humbling honor to be in my position; with thoughtfulness, perceptiveness and partnership my colleagues and I can guarantee the future of Adventism--and its natural transition into a new era of organized religion. 

I intend to write more about that as we go along. For now, consider:

* What would have a greater impact: a million unique visitors per month on a well-designed site about Adventists, or a million Adventists with well-designed methods for showing who they are in the online and offline social networks of which they are currently a part? 
* Should an organization work to make their online presence user friendly or their users online-friendly? 
* What exists in the definition of the Web today that is not the antitype of the historical definition of the church?

I hope you find these questions as intriguing as I do.

A friend of mine gave a very "instant reaction" [write-up of the Tiger Woods ad](http://jodikiely.com/2010/04/08/my-reaction-to-nike%E2%80%99s-post-scandal-tiger-woods-ad/) that caused such a firestorm a few weeks ago. I replied, and thought I'd share my reply here for posterity. Click through to read my response.
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
I'm still torn over the ad. I don't think it is as cohesive as it could be. That said, I think it does send a useful message.

The commercial shows Tiger as a loser. As you said, there is nothing about the to make you want to buy into Tiger or Nike. From a marketing perspective, this is revolutionary-I can't remember seeing anything similar.

If there's one concurrent theme floating about Nike's sea of ads shown in the last 20 years, it is this: let the athletes speak for themselves. Sure they showcase the technology and embrace the cool, but there is nothing that overshadows the athlete herself. Subsequently, Nike ads perpetually cater to the athlete because they see themselves.

It is an extension of the iconic "Just Do It" slogan; what the endorser conveys is something that the athlete watching either can do, has done, or is doing.

For us, presumably, there is less of a connection, but is there an element of this ad that is lost on us yet hits home for athletes? Does the dumbfounded stare, the echo of a hero's words, and the ragged end of a highlight review reel (which I initially confused as flashbulbs) speak volumes to that subset. I think Nike's hoping so.

Again, I'm not sold on it. I think it's a bold approach and a gamble. Clearly there are mixed reviews. But I can believe in that a bit more than a "welcome back" ad-which would put me in mind of Bush's "Mission Accomplished." And I hope that this signals Tiger's intent: a commitment to grow in the light of his loss (scandal) and move to another win (Masters).

Very interesting concept; would you be ok with providing a state-run place for unemployed alcoholics to drink if it meant they no longer loitered around your neighborhood, leaving broken bottles and the smell of urine?

BODY:
I'm constantly concerned with making correct choices and optimizing potential. In fact, the critical eye I cast is the largest source of resolve for my life and work decisions. [I want to be an expert at it](http://softwarecreation.org/2009/how-to-become-an-expert-the-effective-way/), as it is directly related to my work and vocation. This can often be misunderstood, however; here's an example.

**Working at the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists has always meant that you would be working with an older crowd.** This is my third time working for this organization, and if my memory serves correctly I remember being told at the most recent new hire orientation that the environment has improved--the average age is now in the low 50s.

I remember that first temp job I worked about a decade ago; a girl slightly older than me walked past my cubicle, then walked back, introducing herself and declaring that I now was to hang with her small group of under-30 friends in the building. We had a lot of fun together, and built a presence for younger employees that was both natural for us and non-threatening to the older majority.

Fast-forward to 2008. When I accepted my new position, all the people I knew from back then were now in their mid-30s with many of them gone to new opportunities and experiences. While the number of young people had *increased*, there were only three or four friends who hung out at lunch or otherwise. The presence which we had built was lost.

I linked up with these old friends and made plans for outreach. The plan was simple: **if we ever saw a person under 35 sitting alone in the cafeteria, we'd sit next to them** (with their permission). The rest of us would join and hope a good lunch conversation lead to a new friendship.

<a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/images/photo.jpeg"><img alt="photo.jpeg" src="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/assets_c/2010/04/photo-thumb-250x333-47.jpeg" width="250" height="333" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a>**It worked.** Boy did it work. We've had on-site events, happy hours, weekend activities, a Facebook group, and our loosely connected group of "lunch table friends" has swelled to more than thirty--with many old members additionally reconnecting through our online channels. 

**Yet I still wasn't satisfied.** Why? Two reasons: 

1. I never felt that the group was self-sustaining--it required constant management, which is an indicator of participation without engagement. The idea of reaching out to anyone who was alone was replaced with welcoming anyone who sat with us. As a result, we hit a growth plateau.
2. I sensed other groups forming in direct response to the level of intimidation that our group's size and energy (unintentionally) generated. Increasingly when reaching out to others I found our table perceived as a clique--the exact opposite of our original intentions.

Auditing our group by the the standard "The Purpose of a System is What it Does" (thanks, [Adam](http://speedbird.wordpress.com/2009/08/23/on-systems-and-what-they-do/)), I asked people at the table what they imagined would be next for us; where would we grow? The resounding response was that of complacency--the table had done, in fact, much of what it thought was reasonable for a group to do. Soon it became clear that my intentions for the table (identity, advocacy, camaraderie) and the intentions of the table itself (camaraderie, sociality, fun) were rapidly losing alignment. My conversations only served to [exacerbate the situation](http://twitter.com/ichbeninchworm/status/10234069171).

<a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/images/espresso22_leftsiderasfrankenstein.jpg"><img alt="espresso22_leftsiderasfrankenstein.jpg" src="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/assets_c/2010/04/espresso22_leftsiderasfrankenstein-thumb-500x259-45.jpg" width="500" height="259" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a> 

Contrary to appearances  (even to myself, at times), my critical observations were intended as a means to identify and rectify the flaws in our system. Unfortunately, I think our society has developed a habit of allowing criticism without expectation of critic involvement in change. As a result, no one looks to my pointing out what's wrong as a challenge to collaborate on making it right.

I often tell Fru that I only ever complain about the things I care about most. You will not see me whining about traffic or the lunch menu but you will always hear me go on about [functional living](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2010/01/one-of-the-more-interesting.html), [technology and culture](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2007/05/now-that-the-semester-is.html), or [human value](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2009/02/protest-in-the-age-of-detached.html). In these areas I want to make the best choices and optimize the potential available for growth. 

I still haven't solved the problem of the lunch table; I'm looking at options available. I take great interest in the dynamics this group displays and the tremendous potential it has to be a tool for growth, development, and inclusion into the organization at large. These are the things that stretch my brain (as well as my interpersonal relation skills!), and it is the determination that comes from dissatisfaction that seems to proffer the greatest gain.

At the bottom of the article was a quote from French-Algerian philosopher [Albert Camus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus):

***But what is happiness except the simple harmony between a man and the life he leads?***

It was interesting enough that I wanted to confirm its author, and, by doing so, I came to discover more about Albert Camus--particularly his viewpoints which seem to have lent support to the concept of [Absurdism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism). From Wikipedia:

> *"The Absurd," [...] is commonly used in philosophical discourse to refer to the clash between the human search for meaning and the human inability to find any. In this context absurd does not mean "logically impossible," but rather "humanly impossible."*

Coincidentally, I've also been reading [Mere Christianity](http://www.philosophyforlife.com/mctoc.htm) by [C.S. Lewis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CS_Lewis), and this whole idea concept of the absurd struck me as being significant to this reading, particularly as I was early in the book where Lewis discusses duality.

Most have heard of the Daoist principles of yin and yang, though I imagine only a small percentage of those people actually understand what "yin-yang" represents. Daoism seeks to align humanity with the Way of all things (Dao), and the push and pull of forces that creates balance is what yin and yang encapsulate. As such, **yin and yang are the manifested intent of Dao** (this is important to Daoism because Dao itself is nameless and undefined). To put this simply (and perhaps poorly), the duality of yin and yang exist within Dao.

This got me thinking about the duality of good and evil, which is often is equated incorrectly to yin and yang. While there is duality in the concept of good and evil, there is no good or evil in yin and yang for the opposing forces rely upon each other; the absence of yang would be the absence of yin. For many of us, we dream of a world where evil is diminished or extinguished, and this is not possible within the constraints of yin and yang. In a Christian's mind, God is greater than evil and will conquer it once and for all. 

If, then, one believes:
* in duality of good and evil
* in God's superiority over evil

I'm thinking that that person must accept one more thing: in God's superiority over good. 

It sounds weird at first to say that good cannot define God, but the more you think about it the better it gets. What is the meaning of good? If it is to be desirable or approved of--appropriate or qualified for usage--then there must be some superior thing that defines that criterion. In the same way that I cannot use the word "pretty" to define the word "pretty," I cannot call God "good" if good comes from Him. He is the source of good, not good personified. C.S. Lewis alludes to this in his case for the existence of a God but does not follow it for, I assume, fear of confusion.

So if God really is "beyond good," what do we really know about Him? If human life is colored through the shades of good and evil, how can one illustrate something that lies beyond? Do humans even really know God? *Can we know God?* Now you see where Camus and the Absurdists have place in my thinking about these things. 

<a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/images/twitter_leftsider_camus.jpg"><img alt="twitter_leftsider_camus.jpg" src="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/assets_c/2010/04/twitter_leftsider_camus-thumb-500x255-51.jpg" width="500" height="255" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a>

It struck me as fascinating, for the more you think about it, the more you realize that **humans who believe in the existence of a God at some level believe that they are that God's primary purpose.** For the first time in my life I realized how self-centered and ego-driven my own opinions on this subject are. Perhaps the reality is I--and all of humanity--equate to nothing more than a pet project on a shelf that God attends to on the weekends. There is no way we can prove otherwise.

Just food for thought. If you have some interesting opinion on the topic, have at it in the comments.

> *Let's play a game, shall we? The name of the game is called "Imagine." The way it's played is simple: we'll envision recent happenings in the news, but then change them up a bit. Instead of envisioning white people as the main actors in the scenes we'll conjure-the ones who are driving the action-we'll envision black folks or other people of color instead. The object of the game is to imagine the public reaction to the events or incidents, if the main actors were of color, rather than white.*

Hahahahahaha bonus points for referencing the Dragonball movie. America needs to stop making movies where:

1. The non-white character is played by a white man (Avatar: The Last Airbender)
2. The white man discovers the beauty of a culture and leads them to victory (Avatar)

See a trend here? :P

Yesterday I was listening to an old mix from the now defunct Argentinian(?) Electronic music podcast RadioLAE--quite possibly the poorest mix I've heard there but it had a couple epic jems. New to me, this disco song about being a Native American was surprisingly chipper and the vocals quite tremendous. I need to make a note to discover more tracks from this vocalist.

Yes it's campy. Yes it's politically incorrect. Yes, it's disco. But c'mon... are you going to get anything better on this lazy Friday morning? :)

A few weeks ago I encountered a story of a woman who took her kids out of school so that the family could achieve the dream of  travelling around the world by boat. The unintended gem of the story was her mentioning that felt her sons were better off for being pulled out. She bases this on two things:

1. Before, the three boys constantly fought and bickered; after sharing a room on a boat for months, they had learned to be considerate of each other and even work as a unit.

2. Before, the three boys had no interest at all in books, but faced with the option of staring at the sea for months on end, they all became voracious readers.

Saturday I ate lunch at my pastor's house. He recalled when his three kids were small: they were living in Ohio, and his wife stayed home with the kids. They lived in the parsonage and he walked across the yard to his office in the church each day. There was a church school as well, and when the kids were school age they'd just run over to the school minutes before the homeroom bell. He mentioned these years as being formative and so very pivotal to the closeness his family has now as the kids hit puberty.

If I were to assess the entire seven years of dating, year of engagement, and nearly six years of marriage and decide the happiest and most important period it would be our time spent in South Korea immediately after our wedding. We were on the other side of the world--away from everyone and everything we could fall back on. Our building housed our work and church in addition to our apartment; there were weeks (winter) where we barely left the building. That intense proximity created a bond between us, as well as between the people who shared that proximity with us--enough to go back and visit Korea again years later.

**Being together makes things better.** Often, the frustration we experience with others stems from our desire to preserve "mine"; when the option (luxury, even) of [*privus*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/privus) is removed, it is startling to see how quickly unity--or at least *unison*--is achieved.

Talking with my sister on the plight of the single-and-looking, she mentioned how odd Fru and I are: so many people are running around trying to find their match before it's too late, where Fru and I met early, stayed together and *grew together* (In a talk with a sauna buddy, I reflected that this can backfire--it may be impossible to replace a bespoke relationship fourteen years in the making).

But I digress. In this western world of disposable, single-serving, customized playlist, cubicled-yet-space driven living, we give ourselves little opportunity to develop the human mechanism for collaboration. Understand that every step we make towards uniqueness for all brings us closer to being *our own individual species*, and a species of one is virtually extinct. 

<div class="zemanta-img mt-image-right" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; display: block; float: right; width: 310px; "><a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:River_Rocks_%28440298432%29.jpg"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/River_Rocks_%28440298432%29.jpg/300px-River_Rocks_%28440298432%29.jpg" alt="River Rocks" width="300" height="200"></a><p class="zemanta-img-attribution" style="font-size:0.8em">Image via <a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:River_Rocks_%28440298432%29.jpg">Wikipedia</a></p></div>
A species persists precisely because its members work together to overcome the external pressures that threaten it. Cooperation and collaboration is not ideal, it is essential. Like the smoothing of river rocks, being together removes the dross of self and leaves the efficiency of us.

Saw this a while back: People in Wenzhou, China get **straight gangsta** on some would-be thieves... and it gets caught on camera. 

There's so much awesome in this scene to me. First, look at the street at the beginning of the clip. Now look at the street towards the end; all those people for a lady's purse? Then look at how many people get *actively* involved... for a lady's purse. It makes me angry all over again that [something far worse](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/nyregion/26homeless.html) could happen while we all watch... but I've [talked about that at length](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2009/02/protest-in-the-age-of-detached.html) already.

My job has two major functions:

* as assistant communication director of the Adventist world church, I develop the organization's web presence and advise departments, divisions and affiliated entities in areas of branding, usage, experience and best practice.

* as the "web guy" in a department that is 100% Mac (which is 100% not supported by our PC-centric IT department), I become the de facto "computer guy" for any technical issues, at home or even when the team goes on-location.

I've never enough time to do both, and this is especially so right now during our 59th General Conference Session.

## Uh, what's a GC Session?

From the website(one of many under my care):

> The General Conference Session is the forum for electing world church officers and voting changes to the church's Constitution. Delegates also hear reports from each of the 13 administrative regions of the church.

In reality, it's much more than that. You bring a couple hundred workers from my office together with a couple thousand delegates and you can expect that number to double with spouses, children and friends. With that number you then need to provide food, programming, and logistical assistance... which only serves to attract more attendees. **This session we're expecting 60,000 to 80,000 attendees.**

That's right, *80,000 people* from around the world. The city of Atlanta said in a press conference today that they expect $80 million dollars to be injected into their economy from this event, which includes the over 50,000 hotel rooms that have been reserved in the city itself (not counting the outskirts and neighboring towns). It is a massive experience that takes loads of work.

## So what do you do?

My two major functions, of course.

* Identify and request every piece of electronic machinery needed for Communication's needs: In our press box overlooking the Georgia Dome, in our press conference room, and of course, in my development office. Everything; down to phone wires.
* Last thursday I flew down to help the IT department as they set up all this stuff, so that my team could come in and work immediately. They're updating websites, sending press releases, shooting news shows and making podcasts--so the don't want to deal with any hiccups. And if they do hiccup, they call me.
* All of our team's sites (over a dozen) are now run by a single CMS installation, which we're feverishly optimizing while the sites themselves are being improved. My great volunteers have been doing an awesome job making the last pieces fall together--be watching the sites closely because new changes are happening faster and faster!
* Our media generation and distribution has been greatly aided by the use of some new software--Pharos' Mediator4. Telling you all it does would be a total topic unto itself, but the guys at Pharos were kind enough to custom build a demo setup for us to use during the event. This is how all the video/audio were generating will get on the web so fast.
* Our newly christened social media specialist has been firing up twitter and other tools to keep the info about Session releasing at a rapid-fire pace. Just keeping up with her is a task unto its own.
* While our news team has photographers and our media services runs all music on the stage, we often have to grab content on our own for our specific needs. Also for the podcast and other sundry items.

Are you getting the picture? It's a lot of work. So, my great team has been doing all kinds of awesomeness from wifi troubleshooting to image manipulation to css editing to listening to me grumble and moan all day--all with a smile. I love these guys... I need a way to hire them permanently.

<p>Every five years, the <a href="http://www.adventist.org">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a>--the organization <a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2010/04/why-this-work-works-for-me-for-now.html">I work for</a>--has a world business meeting where they elect leadership and refine policy. I'm currently in Atlanta attending my third such session, and this will be the second time that I'll return to find my boss clearing his office for the newly-elected.</p>

<p>As a pragmatic professional and a professional pragmatist, I work for two things: my passion and my paycheck. As long as those two things are appropriately served, I can work with anyone. As these two things have not yet changed as a result of the change in office, I don't expect a better (or worse) road in my future.</p>

<p>It would seem that there are many who seem to find this change exciting. I would caution these people to temper their thoughts. Change can only do three things: make things better, make things worse, or have no effect. All other influences aside, you have a 1 in 3 chance of improvement; behave accordingly.</p>

<p>There are also those who consider this a tragic end of an era. To these I would caution discretion: the last time I lost a boss at a General Conference session, he was replaced by someone who just happens to have been elected president of the organization this week. Besides if you have some personal agenda you are fighting for, there is no worse strategy than to yourself declare it dead.</p>

<p>Finally, to all who have some stake or vested interest in these happenings, I implore moderation. Consider it not absurd that someone who is not a part of your camp could, in fact aid and support your cause. Consider areas where collaborative progress is possible rather than drawing up lines of contention. And consider the health and vitality of the ecosystem <em>over</em> the success of a specific organism. </p>

<p>We <em>are</em> a family; a community. The success of an organization depends on its <a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2010/06/being-together.html">collective value</a>--something I learned watching both outgoing superiors. Let's be gracious cooperators as we build the next five years of this organization's future.</p>

The Economist website has [a brief entry](http://www.economist.com/node/16525240?story_id=16525240&fsrc=rss) that shows this interesting chart: a ratio of what a country's political leader is paid in comparison to the country's GDP per person. Fortunately, it seems Kenya's prime minister Ralia Odinga rejected the pay increase that would have given him 240 times the amount the average person he governs!

Read this article a while back and felt it worth sharing. A girl's softball team that hadn't lost a game in two years offers to forfeit their match against a poorly prepared team who were playing their first game in school history. Instead of destroying the team that showed up with only two bats, no cleats or helmets, the Roncalli softball team offered to take the two hours to teach the other girls "how to get better, not how to get humiliated."

In agreement with the author of the article, this is a great piece for those of us who still believe in sportsmanship, kindness and graciousness. Warm fuzzies all around.

I'm not sure when it became such a controlling part of my life; I imagine back when I was talking a lot of philosophy and world religion classes. </p>

<p>The sky is the biggest thing we know--if you can even call it a thing. It basically is everything that we are not; above us and the clouds and the planes and satellites. It's beyond the stars. There's nowhere you can be and not take a clear view up and see sky.</p>

<p>The moment you try to imagine the vastness of the sky, you are immediately and acutely aware of the finiteness of <em>you</em>. While its immeasurability removes any hope of escaping it, consider how far you would have to go just to take a point of sky directly above you and send it below the horizon. As a morning sun in Central Park can easily be a sunset in Kowloon, two people so far apart can be sharing the same bit of sky.</p>

<p>Why does this impact me so?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>I am reminded that there are things bigger than me.</strong> Things that must squint to look down and see all the places I've been and things I've done. There are things I will never impact, and things that may never be impressed by my efforts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I am reminded that I'm oblivious.</strong> I barely know everything that's happening in my life, let alone all the lives under the same sky I see. Half the time I don't even notice <em>the sky itself</em>--the biggest thing I know. How could I possibly recognize subtleties when I've overlooked the obvious?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>My mountains become mole hills.</strong> Considering the first two, it's hard to find something in my life big enough to make a blip on humanity's radar, let alone all existence. The moment I want to complain I must admit that under this sky someone else has a greater right. It doesn't make me feel better, but it does reduce my moaning and increase my gratitude.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I am warned of the danger in self.</strong> It is looking to self and its issues that allows my worries, wishes and concerns to block out the existence of everything around me--even the sky itself. By looking only at my needs and feelings I disconnect with humanity and magnify my problems and their respective emotions. The wise Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, Hindu, Confucianist or Daoist knows the potential danger in self-led pursuits [<a href="http://bit.ly/b8uUCg">link</a>].</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So forgive the occasional <a href="http://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/18131876899">emo-sounding tweet</a> regarding the sky. I am a guy with self-doubt, uncertainty and personal frustrations, but when I look away from my details and up to the sky I get a reminder of my real objectives: to live, to learn, to share and to appreciate.</p>

<br /> Trying to find the source of this video... it almost seems as if it was released by Old Spice itself. If those figures are accurate, The Man Your Man Could Smell Like is probably going to be in college marketing textbooks very soon.

**UPDATE:** Actually clicking a couple links took me to the actual [adfreak article](http://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak/2010/08/old-spices-agency-flexes-its-bulging-stats.html) which says it comes from Old Spice agency Wieden + Kennedy. Legit stats! Wow!

BODY:
My younger sister has entered a phase where her seeming pastime is to repeatedly lament the quality and repairability of our family. Long story made short, I had typical teenage angst until I went away to boarding school (not because of behavior) in 1995--just months before my parents divorced. My sister bore the brunt of the separation alone and I move on my own shortly after freshman year of college. Today, she and I live walking distance from each other, yet neither of us really see the other nor do we maintain more than occasional obligatory contact with our parents.

This is most certainly a dysfunctional home. It is by no means bad, but there's no one calling it ideal. "Ideal" and "broken" are two different things. My sister sees friends, coworkers, and acquaintances who seem to pretty unanimously have more frequent interaction with their family, and that of a higher caliber. While I question the sampling--the grass *is* always greener, after all--my greater inclination is to identify the recurring theme that exists within these examples yet is absent in our situation.

Over the years I've come to recognize the shortcomings that have led to my familial awkwardness. I believe that these, spun positively, create the basic ingredients for successful family.

* **Shared Experiences** There is no family without a common thread. There must be something that you can relate to/with in order to maintain a familial culture. This is Intercultural Communication 101: perceived cultural similarities are what allow us to make the connections that build the foundation of our grouping. Even if events are not experienced by all parties, communicating the experience allows for understanding and, hopefully, sympathy. In the last 15 years or so, I've had about 10 addresses (which includes time spent living overseas); I moved too frequently to generate large quantities of mutually experienced events and failed to update others as I moved on. This has lead to a bifurcation of one life into many--the most stark being the disconnect/reconnect I experience when visiting Korea.
* **Physical Proximity.** While not the most important aspect, closeness allows for greater preservation of shared values and experiences. It also allows for an atmosphere of family to develop. Close proximity means you see the good and bad; the experiences that are conveyed are not one-sided but real and near to your own. Moving away from my family at a young age and not returning to my home state had a significant impact on the frequency with which I engage with childhood friends and family in non-obligatory situations.
* **Active Maintenance.** Consistent habits help to counter balance life's centrifugal forces. Though spokes start from a center and spread in every direction, the inner and outer hub create a zone where divergent intents can still act cooperatively. Those who amicably share a location but develop varying interests often still find camaraderie, and maintaining daily/frequent contact has nurtured relationships when those involved are forced to be very far apart. Unfortunately, I've never been good at maintaining anything; let alone relationships.
* ** Commitment.** Nearly every conversation I have with my sister about this ends with me offering a theory to be proven: If she, Fru and I made a commitment to have one meal together each day for 90 days, the quality of family-ness between the three of us (I believe) will skyrocket. After that, it would just be up to us to provide active maintenance. I've committed to something similar with Fru as we build our marriage; my sister's being in the area is based on a commitment I made to be closer to her, and I'm hoping to draw others to the area as well.

I don't think my family is broken. With a little effort, small steps could create fantastic improvements. I think that in all relationships--not just mine, not just with family--these elements are proven keys to group-making and group-keeping. Feel free to adjust my recipe to fit your palate.

BODY:
During this business trip to England I was lucky enough to have a colleague who doubled as a tour guide, showing me around many places and things I should have seen on previous visits. 

Our first stop was just a few minutes away in [Windsor](http://www.windsor.gov.uk/), which I knew nothing about. As an American, When I think of the Queen I think of Buckingham Palace; the truth of the matter is it is only one of three royal palaces, with Windsor being the oldest and largest occupied castle in the world (as a side note, the Royal Family also has two private residences).

Windsor is also a lovely village-now-town which surrounds the caste and is surrounded by Windsor Forest. According to my colleague Daryl, the Queen is still fond of horses and dogs, still hunting--with bow and arrow!--and occasionally riding through the forest on the same trails that are now open to the public.

It surprised me that she'd be wandering around in the park--certainly there must be a security detail. "If she's in the park, you may see security at the gates, and maybe a helicopter or something, but she specifically does not want to see security when she's there," he claims. 

Prince Charles (formally *Prince of Wales*) petitioned his mother to make a section of the great park reserved for model planes and kite flying, which he was fond of, and she agreed. 

# What is the Queen's last name?
<img alt="4699557423_b1e621e4cb_o.jpeg" src="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/images/4699557423_b1e621e4cb_o.jpeg" width="338" height="299" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" />This is the first question Daryl asked me, which totally took me aback. "Elizabeth," I responded. He disagreed, but I persisted. "'Queen' is her first name."

He said her last name was Windsor, and Windsor castle was passed down from her family. Wikipedia states:

> Unlike most westerners, many of the world's royal families do not have family names, and those that have adopted them rarely use them. They are referred to instead by their titles, often related to an area ruled or once ruled by that family. The name of a Royal House is not a surname; it is just a convenient way of dynastic identification of individuals.

<a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/images/4922897830_2d59c48ff0_z.jpeg"><img alt="Flag atop Windsor" src="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/assets_c/2010/08/4922897830_2d59c48ff0_z-thumb-350x209-67.jpeg" width="350" height="209" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a>At any rate she *is* of Windsor and she *does* live in the castle. Obviously she travels quite a bit and has several residences to occupy, so there's a way to know if she's home when you visit--a flag that flies from the tallest tower of this hill-set domain. I was lucky enough to see that flag on both of my visits.

# Understanding the Village

Even before visiting Windsor I spoke with someone who kept using the term "village." I just took it as a British colloquialism for town, but upon visiting a castle you immediately recognize the need for a supporting population. Outside the castle walls the peasants worked on the feudal lord's behalf in return for protection.

With most of my time here spent in Reading and Bracknell, I got to see a number of new and old villages. They seem to be focused upon the city center and are entirely walkable--the people work and live *together*. For those villages I saw seemingly not attached to a fortress or castle of some sort, the structure also seems to support an agricultural emphasis, clustering tightly in order to maximize field space. 

Windsor wraps and winds around the castle and along the Thames, and towards its edges are homes provided for the elderly who were in the Royal Family's service. I felt somewhat fonder of the British monarchy after visiting this place, hearing the stories and observing the people. With all the [visits and appearances](http://www.youtube.com/theroyalchannel) they make, it would almost seem as if the Queen and her family still feel as if the Commonwealth is their village, to whom they dutifully protect and provide for in return for their allegiance and support.

Reading [Queen Elizabeth's wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II), I came across this quote from a broadcast she gave on her 21st birthday:

> "I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong."

Admittedly, I knew very little about the Queen before this visit. Though her popularity has had its low points, I cannot help but admire one who commits their entire life (not just an elected term) to the people who make them who they are--and rises above them by their willingness to consider each one part of their own. That kind of intent makes someone *royal* regardless of their pedigree.

There are several other things [besides admiration for the queen](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2010/08/village-and-queen.html) which he planted in my head while there--the first of which is a curiosity for home gardening.

I grew up in the country and my father had a rather large garden. It eventually just became a large strawberry patch and, ultimately, a half-court space for a basketball hoop I received after finishing 8th grade. Since then, I've never even thought of gardening--though I have consistently had a plant or two in the house over the last decade.

My first full day in, Daryl had me over for lunch with his family. A cute house they recently moved into, they'd done some extensive gardening in the backyard. Of particular interest to me was a little box of herbs and leafy things from which we picked ingredients for salad. I thought to myself, "I should do this on my little balcony!"

So I started hunting up information to learn how to [grow my own salad](http://www.growit.umd.edu/Salad%20Tables%20and%20Salad%20Boxes/index.cfm). Also, I'm thinking of [seasonal plants and crops](http://containergardening.about.com/od/containersyearround/tp/Fall_Plants.htm) to potentially make this a year-round activity.

I know it's unlikely that I'll be able to grow enough really replace grocery produce, but perhaps it will lead to an interesting activity that will only expand--perhaps to a place with a bigger balcony?

Despite the very nice composition by [@imnotmok](http://www.twitter.com/imnotmok), All I see when looking at this pic is *bad form*. Haggard eyes, poor posture--and that awful gut.

I know I'm getting old. I'm never going to look as good as I did when I was young (and even less than I thought I looked). But even in aging, one hopes they can grow gracefully rather than ungraciously.

The problem is finding the reason for looking good.

When I look at this photo, what is offended is my pride and self-esteem. I do not see a guy particularly unhealthy or at risk of any sort. I do not feel this person is closer to death than they might assume. I feel, quite frankly, unsexy.

But why do I need to feel sexy? I am past my prime, happily married to a woman who has probably always been a much better looker than yours truly. I'm a lucky man; not a man trying to get lucky. And it would seem that my only concern is that other people find me as attractive as possible.

The fact that this pic makes me want to immediately engage in crunches and pull-ups is so that the young (and not-so-young) pretty females (and let's be honest; even a little from teh gays) of the city will consider me one of their own, who has gone boldly and attractively into the next phase of life. That vision is about as superficial and philosophically vapid as I can imagine. 

So do I turn away and become a virtuous Quasimoto or embrace and become the [Dilf](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=D.I.L.F.) of my vain dreams? Is there some other reason why a reasonably healthy, non-competitive man would want to take on the added cost of moving from average to chiseled?

Why do you assume the reason you look at yourself and want to improve is simply because of the stereotypical "I want the bitches to drool"? Sure, it's instinctual to peacock to attract ladies, but like you said, you're married---and besides, old man, you couldn't keep up with them young ladies quite like a youthful, virile, dapper gent like myself could---so that's not conscious. I doubt it's even subconscious.

Let's think about that time period when people painted pictures of fat girls, ya know, the really pale ones with big round bellies and they're usually just laying on ornate furniture, and there's food somewhere around them so you know all they're doing is lying around getting fatter... You're educated, so it's not like I need to explain this to you, but hey: it's because back then, in order to be fat, you had to be wealthy or you had to have a lot of free time. Being pale, similarly, meant that you weren't some dumb prole stuck out in the fields laboring or building shit. You had time to just sit in doors, out of the sun, 'cause you were wealthy. Being with a pale fat girl meant that you had money, that you had class. It cost both those things to feed a woman til she was bloated back then. If they had McDonald's back then everyone would be with a fat girl.

Now-a-days, of course, being fat means you're probably poor. It also means you're probably stupid, because you don't care about yourself. Lying around, surrounded by food? That's not a statement of class anymore, that's a statement of being a poor, lazy slob. Now if you're tan it doesn't mean "you were out laboring like a prole", it means "you're wealthy enough to have enough free time to concentrate on your tan".

So when you look at yourself, maybe you're thinking this: Damn, I'm not very good at playing my part. I'm a smart, well-educated, and financially well-off man, and look at the dude in that picture: he's slouching, like he's got no confidence. He's got a gut, like he doesn't care about his appearance at all or doesn't have the time to... Dang, I'm even a bit pasty for a black guy, I guess this monitor tan ain't working for me...

In short you're failing to demonstrate your class, which wounds your pride. It might have nothing to do with attracting females, but simply that by failing to impress others, you're failing to impress yourself.

We do not hold ourselves to standards simply because we think others do. We hold ourselves to standards because we hold other people to those same standards. When we don't measure up to our own standards but still hold other people to them (that's really what you're doing here, you're looking at yourself objectively as if you don't know it's you and you're judging yourself) it causes some cognitive dissonance and makes us question everything.

Ouch!

Really like this writing, Stuy. Sorry it got hung up in my spam comments. It's good enough, however, that I'm responding even now.

Your point is well written, and to be honest I've never even thought of it that way. To say that I'm certain your suggestion is not the case would be a dismissal without actual evaluation. Generally (and increasingly) I'm very anti-class [*](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2009/06/unlocked-increasingly-tethered.html), but I'm willing to give it some thought and come back to it later.

I think of counterpoint nearly every time I find myself unintentionally groovin' to [Justin Timberlake's "Rock Your Body"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSVHoHyErBQ) at some gas station or shopping mall or wherever they play music like that. It was a popular song when it released, but no one ever noted the wonderful (and quite rare for our time) polyphony found in its bridge. I'm not even sure if [the girl who sang the other half](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Marquez_(singer)) is still singing, let alone better off due to the song's fame. 

But I digress; we're talking about **counterpoint**--where two (or more) distinct melodies operate simultaneously, relying on each other's presence to bring harmonic effect. Wikipedia considers Bach to be the greatest practitioner, and it seems that it becomes more rare in music as you move forward in history.

I think counterpoint is evidenced in other aspects of life, and can even be considered an ideal outcome for many of our societal problems. What would happen if two opposing points of view positioned themselves to balance the other rather than to assault or defend? What if tools like consideration and empathy were strategically implemented instead of victory and profit? Perhaps even these more aggressive tactics could be paired with more compassionate perspectives to create a third layer--and a clear objective presentation for those looking on.

Counterpoint represents harmony without dependence, collaboration without compulsion; the sum of a positive and  negative being greater than its individual parts. is this something we could find useful in our human development?

A lot of interesting things have happened in the last few months, particularly since the trip to England, yet I've written little about them. For many things, it seemed inappropriate to divulge; perhaps it was the timing, or the potential for change, or the sensitive nature of the topic. I just felt it better if I wrote about these things later, if at all.

It has happened with my tweeting as well. I started slowing down, then I realized I was close to my 10,000th tweet and suddenly screeched to a halt, trying to find something novel to do with that milestone. But even after I finally passed that record number, I found myself reticent to share my thoughts as readily. Part of it was that I was in a particular sour mood, part of it was related to confidentiality and industry secret (ha!), while part of it was just finding the *best* things to say rather than *anything*.

It dawned on me that I was caught in self-repression. I was holding my tongue in fear of something--but what was it? Unsurprisingly, it largely was fear of offending my employer--which says two things: I don't think my employer values when I have differing ideas and that I am reliant upon my employer for my well-being.

This is a recipe for unhappiness. While it may not be instantaneous, I'm committing to a return to honesty, transparency; freedom to speak and to disagree. I'll also be working to provide a way that I can continue to live and act honestly no matter the cost. It might sound like I'm saying I'm saving up in case I get fired, but really I'm saying I'm preparing for what's possible; the sky is the limit and the worst thing that could happen to me right now is that I deny an opportunity for fear of being heard.

BODY:
Today I am broke. Very broke. It is a very temporary broke, and it is due to a reliance upon others to accomplish duties--and that is all that I will say about that. I am personally back on the task and shall remain on the task until a more suitable solution is found.

What frustrates me so intensely about being broke is how it feels: so foreign yet so familiar. I grew up poor and I remember not having money as being the norm. I didn't have an allowance; we did occasionally not pay one bill in order to pay another. It wasn't until being on my own for a couple years that I came to experience a life where life itself was not dictated by what I owed. I was not rich, but I was not under.

I cherished that feeling. I promised myself that my goal would be to feel this way forever. I didn't need wealth; I just needed to not think about money. What started as a simple solution (getting paid $1000/mo; using $1500-limit card to pay all $800 of monthly expenses; paying off card in full each month) grew to literally create a padding around me, shielding me from that past reality of have-nots.

That seems like ages ago. I've forgotten what it feels like to not know which card to use, to wonder if the ATM will give you cash. It burns to feel myself in the red, no longer fireproof. It infuriates me; turns me from the calm philosophical idealist I'm known for into the analytical taskmaster asshole that I am intrinsically. Not only am I broke; I'm miserable.

Regarding the silver lining, I am reminded that there are no perpetual machines. Craftsmanship extends beyond release date and into the extended warranty. I am given a chance to improve the original system--as well as a motivation to apply myself passionately. The holidays may be dimmer than usual, but the new year holds promise of a phoenix-like rebirth of honesty, craftsmanship, and good intent.

Listen up kiddies; here's where I step off the user experience (UX) bandwagon.


-----
EXTENDED BODY:
**It seems like only yesterday:** returning from the experience of life in Korea and having gone back to finish my degree with renewed vigor, I ran across Nathan Shedroff's ["Unified Theory of Design"](http://www.nathan.com/thoughts/unified/). What a treasure! It explained things I never thought of but which made such sense. It was the first exposure to design that I intrinsically understood.

The year was 2006; *the article was written in 1994*.

I was a little behind; sure. I made up for lost time, telling everyone I knew about this new thing I found. I read voraciously, making Cooper's [About Face 3](http://www.cooper.com/#about:books)--my second bible (the Bible being my first bible, of course). I talked night and day about this. I quit my job and started freelancing as an experience designer part time while finishing my degree (UX had given me a reason to). I got an offer to be the web manager for the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, which I accepted. 

##And then I went to San Francisco.

I'd been once before, but this was for an Adaptive Path seminar. It was a utopia: everyone knew what I was talking about! What's more, most of them could tell me a thing or two! I chatted with [Sarah, who I had met before at An Event Apart](http://aneventapart.com/speakers/sarahnelson/), and met [Teresa](http://www.adaptivepath.com/aboutus/teresa.php), who'd later help me define my "UX Mantra."

Over the past two years, I've struggled professionally to put the principles I've learned about user experience design (UXd) into practice for an organization that desperately needs it. Part of that is due to the structure of the org itself, but a lot more of it is due to ignoring change management--that which creates the motivation, skills and knowledge required for people to adopt new systems and procedures. 

It seems a lot easier to do when you're a cool, respected UX agency being paid to come in and make change, but even then there's no guarantee. I see a lot of talk about UX from the venerable halls Adaptive Path and Hot Studios, Ideo and Cooper--but where is the change? More than just a portfolio of novel ideas, are we seeing a new consciousness that's being developed in people?

Without change management, it's a lot like [herding cats](http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/people-change-consulting-services/hearding-cats-human-change-management.jhtml). And when you're in the business of herding cats, you're not in the business of change management--at best you're making cat-herding specialists. 

And then competing against them for cats.

All expressed hilariously in the above tweet. Funny but sad; sad but true. I want to opt out of this unnecessary phase of experience design.

##Today's world is ubiquitoUX, and tomorrow is closer than you think.

When our goal is to out-design the other "UXer," we get to novelty rather than repeatable innovation. I'm not a novel guy; if we're going to see who's cooler, I'm sure I'll lose. But that's not why I got excited about UX--I was drawn by the opportunity to be part of creating a ubiquitous practice.

I recently seized a great opportunity to sit down with [Adam, whose book](http://www.studies-observations.com/everyware/) was also insightful early on. After that conversation I found myself considering the logical progression of UXd as a field of employment. At worst, a tight rein is placed around the study, and design is doled out at a internally-adjusted cost. This would make user experience design a luxury item--available only to those who could afford it. 

At best, and generally in response to such worst-case systems, more and more people will desire to strike gold in the UX rush. *I believe this is happening already.* From the scribe, to the webmaster, and to the journalist, we can just look around us and see where that market saturation will lead--to a common user with the motivation, skills and knowledge to design user experience themselves. *Society manages its own change.*

I for one am ready to kill the cult of cool that prevents this social development. I'm not interested in clutching onto proprietary pursestrings or milking things until they're no longer personally profitable. I'm interested in three things:

* Honesty: a faithful delivery system for accurate information
* Craftsmanship: the zenith of development in every detail
* Good Intent: perpetual gain to the common user and consideration for perspectives

Today's world is user-created. My world is different from yours precisely because I can design my experience for myself, and the world is changing as I contribute content that I create. Why wouldn't it make sense for me, the common user to understand the principles of designing for user experiences? What part of tomorrow's world makes sense with a UX specialist? **Let the common user practice experience design and build a world where its principles are truly universal.**

After a lot of interesting interactions, I've really craved for the time to sit down, think, and map out what's next for me, for Leftsider, and for the world. Starting today, I'm taking off for a week, and my office is closed the following week, so I've got a nice long holiday opportunity to do just that.

There's so much, though, to cover! So yesterday I brought my second haul of books home and readied myself for the *Hyperbolic Time Chamber Vacation.*

The **Hyperbolic Time Chamber** is a bit of *deus ex machina* used by the writers of the Dragonball Z animation series. A minute in the chamber felt as if it were six hours; as such, one day in the chamber would allow for a year of training. The protagonists, faced with a vastly stronger opponent and very little time, somehow stumbled upon the knowledge of the "room of spirit and time" (translated to hyperbolic time chamber in the english translation) and travelled to it for a week's worth of preparation.

I've not yet figured out how to make a hyperbolic time chamber of my own, but during this holiday I'm going to squeeze as much reading, exercise, and contemplation in as his humanly possible. I'm not travelling anywhere. I'm avoiding calls. I intend to delve deep and come back revived. 

After having a nice conversation with [@stuyparker](http://twitter.com/stuyparker), I've been inspired to write daily. I'm hoping to use my HTCV as a springboard for this habit. Let's see how it goes.

Instead of just talking about anime yesterday, I should have explained a little more of what I've been thinking about. I'm still working out specific nomenclature, but I hope my premise still makes sense.

I'm going to be examining, among other things, the cost and benefit of society's shift from monolithic tp modular systems of organization--the organization of information, of people, and of resources. I'll be frank and honest: a lot of this concept has been provoked by reading/listening to Clay Shirky, Adam Greenfield, and Jan Chipchase while being challenged by the non-theoretical applications of people like Anil Dash, Ev Williams and Jeffrey Veen. I'll be pointing pretty heavily to these sources at first, but I hope to expand to new competent sources of information as a result of my research. 

All said and done, my intention is to analyze and evaluate this burgeoning area to the extent that I can competently present and consult on the impact this will have for society and, occupationally, for existing organizations. I'd love to do this for my current organization, but ultimately at some point I'd really enjoy finding new cases for application of the principles I discover. 

If you have any information you think may be relevant to this study, feel free to share.

While reading Clay Shirky's second book, "Cognitive Surplus[ * ](http://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Surplus-Creativity-Generosity-Connected/dp/1594202532)," I was reminded that source of the word *amateur* is the latin word "to love." Professionals do things for compensation; amateurs do the same things without expectation simply because they're passionate about them.

EXTENDED BODY:
Lately I've resumed fretting about my loose association of lunchtime companions, who are now semi-officially known as GCYP-the GC's Younger People. I worried before about potential stagnation and exclusivity[ * ](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2010/04/dissatisfaction-as-a-means-to-determination.html), but with those things fairly resolved I now have been faced with resisting political agenda. We've grown to the point that many expect us to champion a cause or push for some initiative or change. They want access to the "master list" so they can encourage the group participate or enlist their support.

But there is no master list. Every single person who associates with GCYP is a person I have eaten lunch with or have gotten to know personally. I don't sell out my friends, and if you can't contact them without GCYP endorsement maybe you should be a little more people-conscious and a little less goal-driven. GCYP is done because of a passion--not for gain. It is an amateur project, and I'd like it to stay that way.

While many seem to make the word amateur a negative word, it is something we should embrace rather than avoid. Amateur means there is no audience as much as potential collaborators. It means there is a much lower barrier to participation and contribution. And it reinforces the concept of doing for the right reasons.

In the Bible, Jesus hand-picked a loose group of associates who he travelled with and taught. His hope was for those people to do the same with others, and he was specific in calling out two brothers vying for top position and one associate whose aim for profit ultimately turned him traitor. The explosion of the Christian church after the death of Jesus happened largely through amateur avenues.

In sharp contrast, much of the negative reputation Christianity receives today is because of the callousness of its professionalism and the lack of *amare* in its amateur efforts. Everyone has an agenda or an end goal when there should be no intent of gain and simply a passion for others.

What are the ramifications for organizations who decide to do things for love, and specifically not for profit?

BODY:
For most of human civilization, the quality of a product was equivalent to its usefulness. As a hunter, the inferior bow or arrow meant less accuracy; a dull or brittle spearhead was not effective and thus would not be worth purchasing. As a gatherer, good fruit taken meant mouths fed while those rotten or unripe would have no purpose and could instead bring sickness. In all cases from the earliest of man forward, quality meant satisfaction.

That is, until industrialization hit us. Once production left the hands of the artisan and was placed in the steely arms of machinery, the quality of a product became less about the satisfaction it provided and more about production's consistent output. In essence, it became a marker of the minimum effort and skill necessary for consumers to find a product useful; a whole science of quality control has been since developed [*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control), ensuring the highest quality product at the lowest cost point--very useful to the manufacturer but only marginally to the user. When quality became a price point--by which people chose to accept products of mediocre build or spend the extra money for  hand-crafted artisan work--it created the breeding ground for two strange phenomena: the idea of disposability and the sense of "good enough."

EXTENDED BODY:
>  *Le mieux est l'ennemi du bien.*
> 
>  The better is the enemy of the good. --Voltaire [*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire)

As we hurtle through the age of digitalization these things still matter but in different ways. Manufacturers still need to control their output so that it retains a quality that the consumer finds valuable, but the digital product can be duplicated with practically no cost (Consider: how much does it cost you to make a copy of a file on your computer? Two clicks and an allocation of space? How much more does it cost a software company?). As a result, the margin of cost (initial creation + duplication) between a bespoke digital object and a mass-produced one gets smaller every day. Disposability becomes both essential and irrelevant; with low expense, I can use a product for a one-off task (freeware/shareware thrives on this concept)--but why throw it away? The cost to keep it is equally miniscule. There have been times that I've downloaded an application, immediately used it, and just as quickly had no use for it whatsoever; many of those applications still reside on my computer because the effort in finding and deleting is greater than the resource it takes just staying there. relatively new concepts in commerce like the app stores for Android and Apple mobile devices cater specifically to this line of thinking.

This says a lot more about consumer satisfaction than the original industrial process ever did. It says, "if it works, I can do what I planned on doing--and that makes me happy." In truth, a product's usefulness never stopped providing satisfaction; we just lost quality as a tool to measure it. Instead, we chased quality unnecessarily to higher price points that, in many cases, did not really do much difference in the way we enjoyed the results but rather indicated status. Audiophiles may adequately justify their expensive equipment, but there's a reason mainstream producers often take their work out of the studio and listen to it in a car or earbud headphones: when it comes to enjoying the music, often just hearing it is good enough.

Pick a song, any song. If it ever was popular at all, chances are you can find it on YouTube right now. If it had a music video, there's a good chance that is there as well, though more often than not it will simply be a picture of the artist, an album cover, or a collage of marginally-related images that the uploader has put together. Hundreds of thousands of inferior quality audio files attached to inferior quality imagery online--an inferior medium--yet really obscure items like collaboration project Butter 08's 1997 track "Butter of 69" [*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WweOg2krMPE) currently has over 30,000 views. Why would poor quality video or even a static image get hundreds of thousands of views? Because people just want to hear the music, and will often let it play in the background, ignoring the image completely. More importantly, there are scores of downloadable and web-based applications that will extract the audio and give it to you in mp3 form. It nearly guarantees that your audio will not be as good as what was originally recorded, but what does that matter? Just having may be good enough.

Growing up in a lower-income, rural environment, the term "good enough" is imprinted in my bones. With so many things economically and logistically out of reach, adults admonished children to make do with what was available. Today, it seems I wasn't the only one given this advice. In addition to pulling sub-quality (in the industrial sense) audio from unlikely sources, people are using their computers to make phone calls, using their phones to take pictures, and using their photo cameras to record video [*](http://www.wired.com/gadgets/miscellaneous/magazine/17-09/ff_goodenough). Long gone are the days of "the right tool for the job," if it will get it done, it'll do.

This sets the basis for much of the work that many of us do. So very often we are swept up in the latest technology which pushes the boundaries of what is possible when, in reality, our work is much less bleeding edge and much more center of the bell curve. Forget what's new; what's most common to the user? In "About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design," [*](http://www.amazon.com/About-Face-Essentials-Interaction-Design/dp/0470084111) Alan Cooper and team remind us that the center of the expertise scale is exactly where we should be aiming. The high end usually has a learning curve that is not worth the consumer's investment; the low end is too simplistic for most and very few hope to remain clueless users. When we design for the "That'll Do" generation, we bring a balance that humans already have a knack for implementing--through compromise--in their daily lives.

The result is a shift in the post-industrial mentality. The new, post-analogue, digital mentality is one in which the artisan resurfaces, incarnate in every person who creates, manipulates or modifies digitized data. That data itself is by its very nature open to change: edit, deconstruction and reconstruction are its strengths--an attribute never seen before the digital world. Finally, those who see the larger picture of data pervasiveness are given the opportunity to design the parameters by which human interaction with non-human objects is guided.

Perhaps all dreams have an end--not just the ones we experience in our sleep but also the ones that we achieve in our waking hours. Perhaps the destination is truly just the end of a journey. If so, what next? Keep beating a dead horse? On to bigger, brighter things?

What propels us forward, and what are the limits/constraints that propulsion adheres to? It is fantasy to imagine that every person in the world is capable of every possible dream; thus it must mean that there are boundaries to where we should wander as we seek our fortune.

Like Icarus [*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus), perhaps we find that striving too high (or for too long) leaves us depleted of the resources necessary to complete the journey. Perhaps by insisting upon doing/living/being more, we are setting ourselves up for a catastrophic fall from grace.

Thanks to longtime twitter pal @stuyparker[ * ](http://twitter.com/stuyparker), who introduced me (via twitter) to @afg85[ * ](http://twitter.com/afg85), who I met in person last week and promptly started debating with. :)

In response to the bit of postulating [*](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2011/01/good-enough.html) I posted last week, he kindly responded with an entry on his own blog [ *](http://cloudculturecontent.blogspot.com/2011/01/our-vast-digital-wealth.html). He contends two things which conflict with what I wrote.


-----
EXTENDED BODY:
The first contradicts my premise that the industrial revolution changed the definition of quality from the valuation of usefulness to the gradation of production. Instead he argues that what the industrial revolution brought about was a change of focus from the wealthy to the commoner--who could now afford clothing at the factory-reduced prices. I disagree with this categorically: the life of the commoner did not improve during the time period [*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_Acts)  nor is there any indication I see of factories focusing on a different consumer market or even creating something different than what was generated in more traditional settings[ * ](http://www.suite101.com/content/the-rise-of-factories-a97774). In fact, given the high startup cost of developing a factory, my guess is that outside of the (admittedly large) cotton industry most factories created products specifically for high cost.

Even so, is providing goods for common usage enough to change the concept of quality? or to develop an atmosphere of satisfaction? Would not the access to greater material goods eliminate the need to make do? Disposability would certainly persist but the two together are key to innovation.

The second argument he makes is to a comment I left. When he suggested that the beauty of digitization is that now we can "live like the rich," without earnest care for the scarcity of goods, I said:

> I really hope we don't succumb to the idea that "we can live like the rich." This encourages excess, graft, corruption and malevolence.

This, of course, is a strong statement, but one I feel is true. he argues:

> All I can say is this: historically, the wealthy have contributed larger shares of their income to charity, and to patronage of the arts. It is difficult to imagine a renaissance without the generous patronage of the Medicis.

It would be foolish to argue that the affluent have not had a positive influence on society, or to say that all rich people are evil. I suggest neither. Instead, I repeat what I tweeted recently:

It is not the rich I consider worrisome, it is those who imagine what it means to be rich[ * ](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2006/12/big-meals-overpopulation-and-i.html) that garner the greatest concern. As we learn to live digital, I hope we learn to live as efficiently as the medium. The examples of profit-over-humanity leave little to be desired of the live like the rich mentality.

Innovation is not a privilege, nor is it only afforded to the privileged. Innovation is driven by need, which is not the opposite of wealth.

OK, so I think I can see where we may not have managed to communicate what we meant to one another.

I wasn't saying that we can live like the rich, as in, this is something we have aspired to and can now do. In no way am I talking about the pursuit of wealth.

Instead, what I am saying is that if you have access to a computer and the internet, then in terms of anything that can be turned into a digital file, you are mega-rich compared to how much (music, writing, pictures, video) people could afford--either to consume or to make and display publicly--in the past. That's all I'm saying.

I present it not as a stricture of what should be the case or how we should be behaving now. I present it instead as fact--as makers and consumers of content, we are now mega-wealthy. And I believe understanding the implications of that is an important component to understanding how people are likely to behave in our digital, interconnected age.

If I understand you correctly, Adam, what you're actually saying is that the *capacity* for growth and development has increased due to technological advancement. I can't imagine anyone would argue that. We have more than we're able to effectively absorb and even that is beyond what our predecessors of just a few generations could have even imagined. Yes, absolutely.

But the term "rich" is associated with quantity, not capacity, and an excess of the latter is a lot less likely to lead to inequality. If I have a cup and you have a jug, we both can drink from the stream; if it comes to storage of a quantity of water, however, you have the advantage. If it comes to portability or small portions, I can leverage that against your reluctance to share what you've stored. Quantity is where supply and demand seek profit--which is where it is easy to sacrifice society for economy. 

In the digital world, everyone with a digital computing device has a tremendous capacity--to create, to modify, to duplicate and distribute. Private commercial interests fear such a capacity because it threatens the value of the quantity they provide. They are *rich*, and they can be quite nefarious at protecting/maintaining/enhancing their wealth.

I advocate looking beyond wealth to the public ability of self-provision.

Lately I've been finding myself completely baffled by the sincere innocence of others. It is as if, despite their age, they have not seen the world for what it is; their actions and opinions carry hope in humanity that just seems downright unreasonable to me.

Perhaps I look with jaded eyes. It could be that what I have seen enough of to consider normal is actually closer to the basest of man than I perceive. But even if it is, how could I go back to living a life where these depths don't even exist?

Perhaps this is the blight of sin Adam and Eve experienced. The Bible says that upon eating the fruit, their eyes were opened. Once eyes are opened, they have seen--even if they are shut again. I didn't understand that when I was a kid; I understand now.

What I have seen means my eyes will never ever really be closed.

BODY:
Man first produced for survival: necessary tools to build, food to eat, clothing for protection. It is only natural, then, that when products end up traded, purchased or sold we automatically think of the economic model of "supply and demand." Why would someone sell something that they needed, and why would anyone purchase or trade for something of no personal use? Because of surplus and because of need this model has almost become synonymous with the marketplace. Consider, however, its shortcomings for a digital marketplace. 


-----
EXTENDED BODY:
Let's revisit Supply and Demand [*](http://www.investopedia.com/university/economics/economics3.asp). Demand remains constant in a purely digital market, but what is supply? When selling or trading a digital product, the product itself is both the minimum and maximum on-hand quantity necessary for distribution at any level. Downloading an application from a server does not require multiple copies in queue, like a candy dispenser--the speed by which a digital product is available is equivalent to the speed at which I can copy said file to my personal machine. Nor is there any known limit to how many times that original source file can make a duplicate of itself (though certain protections can be placed to prevent duplication). 

In short, infinite/limitless quantity reduces cost to the compensation of effort to provide it. I do not pay for air ever; I do, however, pay for a way to get air into a certain location: a tire, a canister, a hot room and so on. We have seen that the margin of cost between mass produced and bespoke in providing digital products is diminished, so again we can assume the cost should be somewhat less than the consumer learning to create the product or service herself.

This does not mean that efficiency has become a moot point. The creation of a digital game would be much more resource-intensive for me than it would for Sony Computer Entertainment or Electronic Arts; both of these companies have developed considerable systems to streamline and optimize the game creation process that I do not possess. As it pertains to time and expertise, they have a clear advantage that will recuperate the cost of the several additionally involved hands.

Which leads to the second shortcoming: supply and demand in the traditional sense requires consistency. There is a demand for apples, so I provide apples. When an equal demand for oranges arises, I look to fulfill that request as well. Pears, bananas, kiwi come along and soon I am contemplating what I can provide and what I will provide. That I can provide boysenberries to my consumers--and that they will readily buy--does not mitigate the expense of providing several different types of fruits from several logistically distinct sources. I may ignore a cry for fruit pastries altogether. 

In the same way, a digital provider must be mindful that provisions made for demand do not outstretch the revenue earned from providing. It may cost a digital artisan absolutely nothing to duplicate their product, but how much would it cost to create a version in English? Or in Hindi, which has nearly 80% as many speakers (according to Weber's "The World's 10 Most Influential Languages")? In many cases it will depend on who your target audience is. This, again, takes a very monolithic approach to defining demand.

When we move to something more of a product's functionality than simply the language it uses, we find that defining the audience requires some large-scale generalizations. There is no product in any market that is designed for one specific person; rather, products are designed to have a certain level of value to many people in a very approximate way. Again, consumers are then left to decide if they want something that works specifically for them or costs the same as it does everyone else. With the potential for custom digital products to be much less cost-prohibitive, we create an opportunity for the quantity of supply to be proportional to the quantity for demand at a level of 1:1--a product created for each purpose of each consumer.

Of course, this utopian vision is retarded by the "make do" mentality. Humans balance their daily lives through sundry-yet-intricate compromises, and for the majority of the earth's population, "good enough" is much more reasonable than "exactly right." 

In fact, in many cases, we will see consumers combine objects to create or aid in the creation of the solutions they're actually looking for. This brings us to the final shortcoming of supply and demand: it is based upon supply and demand being independent. The future of the digital world is one where the creator of an object may very well be the sole source of demand for an object, hence making a market pricing irrelevant. Having no intended monetary return, it can be squirreled away as a one-time digital application or can be "discarded" by placing it out where others may partake with no expectation of compensation. 

It is in this latter option that we find the tremendous potential for digital growth.

A few comments:

Supply and demand are always impossible to disentangle when you start digging. After all, my "demand" for an orange comes from my ability to pay for it, which I can only do if I have supplied someone else with something that they have paid me for, which they can only do if they have supplied someone else with something they have been paid for, etc. Even if you're the child of a rich person, your demand ultimately is derived from someone supplying something at some point.

This is even true for the digital world. To read your blog, someone has to have a computer (or smartphone) of some sort, and an internet connection. In order to get those things, someone either has to supply something themselves--oranges or maybe their labor--so that they can pay for them personally, or maybe someone else gave them to the person as a gift--in which case the gift-giver had to supply something at some point to be able to afford to do so.

Once you have the computer and the internet access, though, you can effectively demand content from a vast universe of digital stuff that you don't have to pay a penny for. Get enough of that kind of "demand"--in the form of attention--and advertisers will pay a digital producer for it, or the digital producer will find some other way to make a little money if not a living off of their creations.

But I think you're right that the true charm of the digital era is that someone can create something that satisfies their inner artisan, their desire for self expression, with "no intended monetary return", and the product of that desire will be around for the rest of us to enrich our lives.

I once asked who benefits from the internet, and concluded that it was those who loved art of any kind--including the people who create it.

It's definitely difficult to imagine supply and demand as unrelated, and I'm not sure if they can be separated. In the digital context, supply struggles--what is quantity when one (digital file) equals infinity (via duplication)? I suggest that perhaps demand, being related, struggles as well.

Perhaps supply and demand to not struggle at all, but rather our understanding of them. I grew up in a community that placed high emphasis on learning a trade; it would not only provide a source of income but an ability to create things that perhaps were unaffordable. Brothers could literally build the house they couldn't afford to buy. I suggest that digital products provide a similar opportunity. Remember that the original definition of an artisan is one who is skilled in a trade, not an artist. The internet indeed benefits those who are not afraid to create or modify, and I think my latest post starts down that road.

BODY:
Writing a letter or official document has always needed special attention and care. When proclamations needed to be sent out across dynastic-era China, however, the sheer volume of reproduction necessary required a system less time consuming. Woodblock printing became a norm for this kind of task, and was appropriate for the job as Chinese writing has a pictogram (based on drawing) and ideogram (representing a concept) character basis.

Even so, in the 11th century, Chinese commoner Bi Sheng developed a movable type printing technology using clay blocks. This was improved on by Wang Zhen who is credited with inventing in 1298 the first wooden movable type printing in the world. Metal blocks were developed in Korea in 1234 and the oldest surviving metal print book was printed in 1377, approximately 78 years before Johannes Gutenberg's 42-Line Bibles were printed.

What's special about movable type printing is its flexibility. Before, a printed page required a monolithic mirrored carving; that carving would only be useful for that one process and nothing more. Movable type was a carving of each character, and the arrangement of these characters could be reformulated--making the blocks reusable. Clearly this would have a greater impact in languages that use an alphabetic script, and Gutenberg's press changed printing forever.


-----
EXTENDED BODY:
Much has been said about the impact that movable type has had on print culture, information sharing, market capacity and society in general. Gutenberg is listed as the most influential man in the last 1000 years on several rankings. But I'd like to stay focused on the flexible medium that allowed all this to happen. There we find some interesting clues to activities occurring in our own world today.

Taking a large item and breaking it into smaller parts is not new. A mason carves stones from a mountainside to create a wall miles away; items purchased from the market are divided into portions that can be transported in bags. What movable type offers, however, is fragmentation to the smallest size of common value. This greatest common denominator could then be implemented in any larger system which required it, and tremendously extended the value of something that originally was designed for single use. In fact, printing the word "pan" and the word "nap"--two words having completely different meanings altogether--use the exact same parts. Add an "e" and you've got "nape," "pen," "pea" and so on. 

In "Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations," Clay Shirky explains how an increase quantity does not always have an equivalent increase in function. In this case, the increase in individually applicable characters increases quite dramatically. This seems obvious, but consider how much less useless your computer keyboard would be if your "e" and "w" keys were joined as one doubled sized key that output "we." Even though you end up with just one less key, the keyboard would be largely unusable. You'd be likely to throw out that keyboard--provided it isn't attached to your laptop.

In today's world, our interaction with products yield a similar malaise. Because a product is designed to appease a target audience--and not a specific person--it may be uncommon to find commercially distributed goods that are designed to serve the greatest common factor; the basis of all needs. Instead, we are often given something of a least common denominator--the smallest thing under which all our collective problem fits. It is no different in the digital realm; something added (bloatware), something missing (crippleware) or something broken into sections (a template or model) rather than broken into elemental values, the keys to development.

But not all digital products have this problem. Digital products that have no commercial intent are less likely to be designed to meet the needs of many; as such they maybe be very useful to a select few. When combined with other products, they may contribute to a system that is dramatically more flexible specifically because it is constructed of pieces of small, common value. 

Because digital products have a particular disposition to duplication and modification, they are much easier to adapt than tangible items. One digital tool applied to an audio file and another converting that audio file creates a ringtone that perhaps I should have purchased. While photoshopping, mashups and program cracks push the boundaries of ethics and integrity, not everything that the flexibility of modularity affords must border on the illicit. A positive (though presented in a way not immediately clear) example would be Yahoo pipes.

When we allow the consumer to participate in the creation of digital content as equals--ripping, modifying, remixing without reservation--we are seeing the digital version of the movable type: rapid reformulation, reusability of one-off tools, and dramatic expansion in opportunistic range. Which essentially is the basis of the revolution that changed everything.

A few years ago, I was sitting on a low stool in my (possibly favorite) apartment when Fru called from the kitchen, "Would you like some cereal?"

"Yes," I replied.

"You want Chex?"

"Sure."

"Do you want me to add raisins?" **And it was with this question that I attained enlightenment.**

-----
EXTENDED BODY:

Time stopped, and I wondered about what I should say. If she had given me a bowl of cereal--with raisins or without--I would have been happy. But because she asked my selection would now establish expectations. 

If I said "no thank you" but she brought my bowl with raisins added I'd be disappointed--even though a bowl with raisins would have been perfectly acceptable if she had never asked. The converse would yield the same result. In fact I had asked for raisins and she complied, the *amount* of raisins in my cereal could fall short of my expectations and leave me disappointed. 

Thus I came to a conclusion:

I'm not saying don't have standards. I'm not saying you're stupid to have goals. I'm saying be careful the expectations you make because every expectation is an opportunity for disappointment. I'm not the first to discover this [*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha).

When I had that realization, I worked for a long time to remove expectation (in the form of preference [*](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2008/03/the-end-of-preference.html) ) from my life. I was unsuccessful. Only recently have I deliberately allowed myself to strive or to yearn for things, and the first feeling that wells up is fear--the fear of disappointment and failure.

Therefore I do not feel that my realization is false. Rather, I accept it as a truth which I cannot currently attain. Man is no more able to remove expectation and preference from his life than he is to remove disappointment and dissatisfaction. Accepting this reinforces my assertion.

I'd like to share a little of what I've been doing at work.

In 2008 I was hired to manage [adventist.org](http://www.adventist.org). It is the official website of the Seventh-day Adventist church, and I was excited to take on such a visible project. Three years later, the site looks largely the same as it did then, but I think this butterfly is about ready to break from its cocoon. 

I'll try to be honest without being whiny; while the world headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist church is a huge vehicle for change in the lives of millions of people around the world, it cruises along on many independently-controlled wheels. While corporate strategies are developed and implemented throughout its departments, it is done so in the manner that the departments decide. Especially when it comes to web, there is nothing outside of a few guidelines for the community at large [*](http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/guidelines/web-site-guidelines.html) to act as policy for developing online presence. 

Instead of handling the sexy details of the job, I went straight to work behind the scenes. I established a content management platform for official Communication websites (yes, there was no CMS when I got here--my predecessor updated content via Dreamweaver or an editor of choice). This allowed the management of content to expand beyond my desk, involving PR and others who were responsible for creating content. Today, nearly a dozen individuals are handling content--that distributes across about 15 sites--via a single point of entry. We're no North Temple [*](http://northtemple.com/), but hey, maybe in a couple years... :)

I also started managing projects in a way more along the lines of iteration and goal-directed design that I found while reading Alan Cooper's seminal work [*](http://www.cooper.com/journal/2007/05/about_face_3_foreword.html). Concepts like site versioning, personas, contextual scenarios, ticketing and staging drove my colleagues crazy--they're communicators, not designers, after all. Over time things made sense and we could see progress behind us--as well as ahead of us.

The big hurdle, though, was fragmentation. Nearly every department already has it's own website and even its own logo; the power of an official website is nil when its content is siphoned off to other online destinations. We struggled long and hard to come up with a solution; without one, a redesign of our flagship site would be new wallpaper on empty, abandoned walls.

If you thought working under the hood was ugly, you've never had to deal with organizational politics.

One of the benefits of shedding most of what you own and moving across the country is the opportunity to be deliberate about the new lifestyle you want to establish as you settle in. Whether you'd like to change your life completely, reorient yourself to an established intention, or reinforce a current course [°](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2011/01/expectation.html), relocation provides a clean canvas to illustrate your ideals.

Having read Vatsayana's depiction of the ideal life of a citizen in the *Kama Sutra* [°](http://www.bharatadesam.com/literature/vatsyayana_kamasutras/vatsyayana_kamasutra_4.php), I was really excited to find our new residence blocks from the bay, relatively quiet yet convenient to the city, and even providing a small backyard with aromatic and fruit-bearing palntings. He'd certainly be pleased.

Still, his recommendation for daily living has a scent of conspicuous consumption about it. I'm not sure of my immunity against Affluenza [°](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affluenza) so modification is necessary. I've always been interested in simple living [°](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living). 

Reading on Epicureanism [°](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism) , I find that:

> In the Epicurean view, the highest pleasure (tranquility and freedom from fear) was obtained by knowledge, friendship, and living a virtuous and temperate life. He lauded the simple life, and advocated reducing one's desires [...]

This highest pleasure is known as *Ataraxia* [°](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataraxia). How can we use technology to promote and disperse ataraxia--tranquility and freedom from fear? I'll be thinking about this as I develop the tone of my new life here in San Francisco.

Four months ago I left my job, got rid of most of my possessions and moved from the DC Metro area to the San Francisco Bay area. I think I'm ready to share how I feel about these two cities.
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
First, it should be noted that I am a big fan of [caution when making assessments](http://leftsider.com/test01/2010/07/on-new-leadership/). I generally say "keep your mouth shut for at least 90 days" when it comes to saying how I feel. Things are rarely as they seem at the start, and living in SF is no different. 

Next, I want to show no ill will to either city. These are towns that are known more for their stereotypes than for what they really are; You can live a long time in a place and only then, suddenly, see what's going on beyond the front presentation. No city is perfect, and this analogy shows how both cities have inherent flaws.

So that being said... DC is a giant robot; SF is a soulless corpse. 

And here's why: the District was never meant to be a lively neighborhood; it was built as an engine for a nation. Everything that makes a city is present in the city, but there is not algorithmic equation for a city's vibrancy and soul. For decades the city literally went to sleep at the end of the day, and only recently has DC come to have anything resembling a nightlife or a social scene. 

For like any sentient robot, you design subordinate systems to fill the gaps between where you are, and where you need to be. Right now Washington, D.C., is developing peripherals that make it almost impossible to distinguish it from a real city. This is the thing we actually fear about real robots.

San Francisco, on the other hand, was a real city. A real city with real residents, real history, real tragedy and real triumph. It exuded confidence and soul and true independence from societal norms. And that was attractive to many, if not all.

Everyone knows that the ingredients for a zombie is one part parasite and one part host. That host is more useful if it willingly accepts the parasite's demands. In horror movies, most people are unwilling--so parasites often go for the dead, making them undead. But what if a host willingly allowed parasites in?

Well, that's San Francisco in a nutshell. A ton of people not from here pretending they know what SF is and fundamentally changing the city according to those ideas while accomplishing their own goals. Meanwhile the host city becomes ragged, more spastic, and--most importantly--less and less of what it was.

I've just become one of the horde that is sucking what life is left from San Francisco. Its corpse still functions, but its soul is largely gone. Where DC never had a heart (and is getting closer to creating one) SF offered up its life's essence to a flood of people who had no interest in seeing it work in the first place. I see it in the dirtiness of the streets, the casualness to rules and the marked absence of advocacy for the preservation of what once was.

So that's my opinion on SF, in comparison to DC.

I've tossed around the word hipster quite frivolously, a term I've used to describe anyone proud of their awkwardness,  running askew to the norm; the girl who liked all the bands before the were popular or the boy who insists on wearing suspenders and cuffed pants.

In retrospect, I guess it was a term I used with fondness--the equivalent of a sigh and a ruffling of their hair while I chuckle, "what am I going to do with you?" in that way that shows as much affection as it does reproach. Visiting NYC, I saw them en masse and certainly felt their community gave them more credibility. 

Now, however, my opinion of the word has soured.

In thinking of the parasitic way of living I've accepted, I'm inclined to assume (from my experience only) that even the leech dreams of being a regular and vital organ of the host. I don't *want* to suck SF dry and walk away; I'd love to discover a true sense of understanding of the city, it's people, their history and composition.

But I am an aspirant from the East with no reason to be living here but for my job. I moved from a luxury apartment in one of the best neighborhoods in the DC Metro area. Add this to my abstention and other things, and I stand out and apart from the city I now call home.

So what does one do feel more authentic? He finds replicable elements in the things he considers real and dons them. The underground music scene, working class neighborhood bar, the sartorial sensibility of the service sector. Tats are real enough, and so is disdain for the appearance of affluence.

It is not uncommon to find the the strongest opinions from those with the weakest ties. Even I, having spent two posts now talking around these concepts am to blame. I yearn for the simplicity and honesty I see in my grandfather's generation, but were I to raid his closet and play his music, what would make me less fraudulent, more acceptable than the average [hipster](http://bit.ly/15G2xB)? What could I possibly do besides progress that would not make me an adherent to nostalgia? Hipsterism is non-progressive.

I woke up disturbed; out of my bedroom window I always hear the white noise of the nearby 280... but this time I was almost certain I could hear *people screaming* beneath it. 

Turns out it was [the San Francisco Marathon](http://www.thesfmarathon.com/), and a bunch of trainers from a fitness club had posted up around the block to cheer and encourage the runners. Tav and I went out and watched the runners pass for a while.

"I can do that," I thought to myself, but almost immediately changed my mind.

"I could do that," I corrected, "at one point. Maybe not that long ago. But not now."

And, of course, this made me ask myself: Why can't I do it now?

The short answer is that I'm not in shape; the long answer is that I've not maintained my shape. It's one thing to get fit; it's another to stay fit.

This was a way of thinking that I hadn't really explored before. We always think of leadership as pushing forward and addressing issues, discovering uncharted territory and looking to the future. We hardly consider the administrator as a leader--no more than we think of the traffic director in the same we do the movie director.

But I've done a terrible job at administrating. I've hopped from idea to idea to idea, travelling the world and looking at every thing I can for inspiration. But what about *standardization*? What in my life is the same as it has always been, and what steps have I made to ensure some things don't change/fade/die?

Now that I'm here in California--and not in DC or Korea or Delaware--and everything is new, my habit would be to embrace the present and abandon the past. But I'd like to do something different this time. Rather than letting my languages languish or my friendships falter, I want to try my hand at maintenance.

Doing so not only prevents the tremendous cost of starting anew on something I've already done but also forces me to address *capacity* and *priority*. What can I reasonably maintain, and what must be sacrificed?

Among the many excuses I've spouted for not writing, the most nearly removed is a need to transition from [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.com) to an open-source variant, [Open Melody](http://www.openmelody.org). 

There are a number of reasons why I made the switch. First. MT's parent company, Six Apart, is no longer extant. Next, While I've threatened for years to write an entry about there not being one competent, consistent and available MT developer in existance, I have enjoyed the discussions I've had with the developers of Open Melody, largely through work I've down with [Endevver](http://www.endevver.com). And finally, because I find the MT markup language elegant and useful enough to disuade me from learning anything else (a stab at working in Wordpress for a recent project had me wanting to stab my eyes out).

There are certainly some issues I'm encountering during the transition, but my intent is to apply daily attention to this task so that, little by little, the job is done.  I'm already fully migrated and now just tweaking design and effects.

One thing I am considering is the removal of comments. I'm wondering if commenting is dead and perhaps integration with Facebook, Twitter and Google+ would better serve conversation. We'll see where that leads.

When I was young I was a member of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinders_(Seventh-day_Adventist)">Pathfinders</a>, a youth activity program that is directed by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. My parents were involved in running the program, so even before I was old enough to participate (Pathfinders are generally aged 10-15) I was attending workshops, camping and enjoying the program.

A lot of the direction and the instruction I remember of my youth came from that period of my life. Even now I remember the Pathfinder pledge and law as if I still recited it regularly:

**The Pathfinder Pledge:**

> By the grace of God
> I will be pure, kind, and true
> I will keep the Pathfinder Law
> I will be a servant of God and a friend to man.

**The Pathfinder Law is for me to:**

* Keep the Morning Watch
* Do my honest part
* Care for my body
* Keep a level eye
* Be courteous and obedient
* Walk softly in the sanctuary
* Keep a song in my heart, and
* Go on God's errands

I feel very fortunate to have embedded such earnest, uncomplicated life goals at such a young age. Decades later, I can see the pattern these credos have placed on my actions and decision-making as an adult. 

There's a significant chance I'll take some (or all) of these concepts and expound on them individually. Even so, what early developmental elements do you see guiding the way you live and operate today?

I'm the kind of guy who spends a lot of time thinking about things... too much, usually. One thing I feel I always should ponder is who I should thank.

It's more complicated than it seems. For example, if I had not become friends with a certain kid named Jason my freshman year of high school, I'd have never met my wife, would never have gotten the job that allowed me to go to Korea, nor would I have been in a position to take advantage of the opportunity to work at Twitter (have I written about that?). 

Jason did nothing but befriend me, but he is one of the most influential people in my life. I did nothing to deserve much of what I've enjoyed in my life. I feel I've been a pretty mediocre performer in much of what I do, and I dont hide this fact. There's a term I love, "unmerited favor," that I think is a big part of my life. This term is also a definition for "grace."

At the beginning of the [Pledge and Law](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/#001240) I learned so many years ago, there lies a condition to all that a Pathfinder is and that one might become: by the grace of God. Considering that most of my childhood friends have criminal records, most of my high school friends are divorced, and most of my family hasn't seen the other side of this country--let alone the other side of the world, I consider myself privileged far beyond what I deserve, and favored in ways I can't explain.

The happiness I enjoy is not the culmination of my efforts, but the gracious gift One was kind enough to bestow. It's good to remind myself of that, and to start my intentions from a point of thankfulness.

Twitter has fundamentally changed the way I live. When I started using it five years ago, my first interest was finding the location of the coworkers I played ping pong with when I felt like playing a game *(Fun fact: Every one of those people stopped using the service within a week, with only [@smellvin](http://twitter.com/smellvin) returning)*.

I met other people and used it sorta like a chat room. I applied for a chance to write for [eHub](http://emilychang.com/ehub/), which was not paid but opened the way for some [real work](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/readwriteweb_new_design.php). Somehow I managed to use Twitter to get paid! Amazing!

Fast forward three years and now I'm *actually getting paid by Twitter.* All the years of heavy usage and advocacy paid off, it seems. But if I'm completely honest, I'll have to admit that I've [struggled with its growth]() and have tried [numerous times]()--all unsuccessfully--to use it in a way that works for me perfectly. I've never been able to do that.

Today I got rid of the lists I'd previously created, and now I'm looking for a new solution. How can I hear new and interesting things while filtering out unnecessary noise? How can I participate in select conversations while effectively ignoring others. Can I still serve my OCD-like tendency to read every tweet when I've doubled the people I follow, or will I have to learn some new way to find what's of interest to me?

I'll have to report back with any solutions I find.

When I was young, I refused to believe anything was impossible; it merely needed to be understood. I have a track record of taking on things that are bigger than me (the detractor could argue this as a fancy way of saying "overreaching my capabilities"). All I ever wanted in life was for someone to show me the way.

But now I'm a man. I've a wife, a vocation; a receding hairline... I'm not the kid I used to be no matter how hard I try.


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>personal realization: though I may reject status and "professionality," I'm not a youth or dread anymore.

So I've been thinking about what it means to be a man. If I'm honest, it seems a lot of what it means to be a man is to be *not a boy.* Not inquisitive, not defiant, not hopelessly hopeful. But that's how, deep inside, I really feel. I still think nothing is impossible--only not yet understood. I still am waiting for someone to teach me, though I realize now that It's more likely that I'll be taught through my own errors than any benevolent mentor. Hardly efficient, but I guess men aren't spoon-fed, either.

Every year I change my bio on Twitter to a new personal credo. Recent ones have been:

* People are behind everything
* On a treadmill called life: getting stronger, going nowhere
* Honesty, Craftsmanship, Good Intent
* Exploring lowest common values

This year, like others, I see a shift in emphasis...

##Change your mind.

In a general sense, it is a call to action, encouraging all who read to be the catalyst in the development of their being. I believe this is important because, with the understanding that change is the only constant, the sole alternative is for your mind to be changed, to be formed by external forces rather than by your own.

More personally, it is an acceptance of failure. It is permission to accept error; to move forward. In watching an interview of Twyla Tharp recently([#](http://bit.ly/x7GTqs)), I was struck by her defining success and failure by the amount of time it takes to accept failure and move on. In personal reflection, I am notorious for analyzing and rehashing what is past; beating myself up for stupid mistakes long gone.

I don't want to grow old before my time. I need to let go of the sins of the past by changing my mind. It may well be that changing your mind could be the hardest thing to do when you're old (and unpracticed). This year I want to put into practice the ability to be free abandon sinking ships, to change sides long before loyalty prevents me and to grow as a result.

**tl:dr:** you.

This question always seems to be a touchy subject, but I thought of it the other day and wondered what was so strange about it. In retrospect, perhaps the question of why bad things happen in the world is taboo because we're afraid to cast blame.

I think the first step is to analyze the question, saving variations for later:

*"If there is a God, why do bad things happen?"*

The primary idea our question asserts is that God is supposed to make everything good, or has made everything good. No one asks, "if there is a sun, why do bad things happen?" because no one expects the sun to have any real impact on good and bad things. So the first thing to consider is your preconceptions of what a god would be like.

The next thing is less obvious because we are focused on the conditional "if there is a God." But really: why do bad things happen? In all seriousness, bad things happen because we do them. It's not rocket science; when we don't do bad things, bad things don't happen. 

"But," you may counter, "we don't make earthquakes and famines... we don't make wild animal attacks or even death in general. We don't make cancer or debilitating illnesses." This is naive. Natural disasters, while not human-crafted, are often human triggered. The catalyst we create may be building for generations, thus less visible to the casual observer. Even animal response to man is our doing. And these "act of god" disasters, while tragic, seem microscopic in number when compared with human-inflicted travesties. If all I had to worry about in life was hurricanes, tornadoes and animal tramplings, I think this world would be much closer to perfect than I can imagine.

The less than perfect scenario for this world would be the one that the question implies is the best--a world where a god solely allows good to occur. In this alternative, bad things *couldn't* happen because God wouldn't let them. I fail to see this as ideal; our ability to learn wouldn't exist--I can't learn from mistakes because mistakes are bad; moreover I can't be *lacking in knowledge* because that's a bad thing as well, so I'd need to immediately know and be able to apply everything in an optimal way. I'd be a machine, with no alternatives except the ones that were designed for me. 

I believe that we were given the ability to choose precisely so we could be more than just a routine. This means we will have amazing successes as well as horrible mistakes. We also have the capacity to learn from both and constantly improve. 

Unfortunately, we have learned to only look at things from a selected few perspectives: our own, what media tells us, and those that are convenient to us. I will not say that we live in a perfect world, but I will question whether our world is getting better or worse. Human longevity has increased, health and education as a species has improved overall, and we are able to exist in numbers far higher than were possible even a century ago. We can't see the change in Djibouti or Caracas or Nagano; we can only see change through our parents getting old, the news of war and loss, and our associates' perspectives. These few glimpses--which is often all we have--are forming our understanding of "bad things." And we never even consider what would happen if these things never occurred. 

In short, If there is a God, he has given us equal opportunity to make things bad or make things good through the ability of choice. We have created systems to persist; the purpose of our system is made visible in its output. We have created marvelous things and have pumped out some awful byproducts along the way. But because we are given dominion over this world we have the ability to mitigate the bad and amplify the good. Taking this challenge, rather than asserting that any challenge is indication of the lack of a higher power, gives us the opportunity to learn and grow. It gives us the opportunity of self-realization. I hope, perhaps, that leads to greater understanding of God as well.

There are variations to the question. 

*"If God is good..."* Well, we have yet to understand ourselves fully, let alone God's plan for us. Yet though we do not even know God's intent we assume his nature? And should we be able to fully comprehend and articulate God's being? Would that not make God something we can create? I posit that this is what many "God-fearing" individuals may be doing now in their push to make others believe in their God.

*"...why does evil exist?"* Hmm. In the same way, our definitions of "bad" and "evil" are based on limited information, and therefore are hard to a) label as a fault, and b) imagine the absence of. It is my hope that our efforts towards good will be critically analyzed to help us further understand the optimal and chart our way towards it.

There's little that depresses me more than the plight of the black American. Let me tell you why.

First and foremost, I am black. This depresses me in more ways than are worth telling. Mostly because when I say that I am black there are people (who are black) who will say, "yeah... ok," because they think there's something about who I am, what I do, and why I do them that is intrinsically *not black*. Compounding the blow, there are non-black people who will say, "you don't act black," confirming the arguments of the former. 

This places a tremendous amount of pressure upon me to prove my blackness. But what does it mean to be black? Do I have to be oppressed, disadvantaged, angry or struggling to qualify? And why on earth would someone want to be considered part of a group defined as such? If I have to stomp around, throw dirt on my face and act sad for you to believe that I am and always will be black, fuck you. I hope that moment of "angry black man" satisfies.

It also means that I'll have to spend additional energy informing your assumptions about me. Ignoring how I make old women nervous and young women avoid eye contact. Having conversations about sports and urban music and stereotypes that aren't at all who I am. Going above and beyond to keep myself innocent (which should never have to be deliberate).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>"I am a black man. This is one of the realities I have lived. My parents prepared me for it...They gave me 'The Talk.'" <a href="http://t.co/plyO590r" title="http://n.pr/GDNu1F">n.pr/GDNu1F</a></p>&mdash; Andy Carvin (@acarvin) <a href="https://twitter.com/acarvin/status/183297880021417984" data-datetime="2012-03-23T21:03:14+00:00">March 23, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But I digress. Deeper still, the second reason is the emptiness in being black. No one *not* black wants to be part of the black community. And if they do, it's for the wrong reasons. Because you bought into that rap music-as-lifestyle idiocy? Because you want to be "soulful." [Because you're minority and/or fanatic about sports.](http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7601157/the-headline-tweet-unfair-significance-jeremy-lin) Because you hate your parent/local authority and we're the enemy of that figure so we're your friend. If you are any of these, refer to paragraph 3, sentence 5.

I want to be black--despite the insistence of others that I don't. There are others like me. And at one time, we and others all lived together because we weren't allowed to live anywhere else. The busboy and the schoolteacher and the janitor and the doctor all in the colored section of the city with the black poet and musician and footballer and preacher and criminal. We were a community, unjustly treated, but a cohesive unit nonetheless.

When freed from the confines of "[separate but equal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separate_but_equal)," something strange happened. At some point we stopped living together. The more successful of us could afford to live better so we did. Doctors moved in to doctors' neighborhoods; businessmen, lawyers and all the rest followed suit. And all that was left in the black neighborhood wasn't our best.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Am I racist to have learned over time that I should be wary of hooded non-white figures? Is it racist to be afraid of a real statistic?</p>&mdash; amiantos (@amiantos) <a href="https://twitter.com/amiantos/status/184654069254733826" data-datetime="2012-03-27T14:52:15+00:00">March 27, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

If you were to think today of a place where the populace was overwhelmingly black, you'd probably not want to live there. Black neighborhoods (or the entirety of Africa for that matter) are more likely to elicit feelings of pity rather than envy. The good that comes from there--geniuses, athletes, entertainers, and so on--is plucked quickly and placed in a more fertile environment. In urban settings, what doesn't get taken fights to be free or is ostracized for it's differences. 

This process perpetuates our plight. People come to think of black by these polarities--the stars and the slums--and are both attracted and repulsed by both. Little black youths in troubled environments have no nearby bastions of success to model after; instead they have Oprah and Lebron to aspire to--and find the troubling options more attainable. It's my opinion that black societal development has largely been stagnant since the 70s, with [the Cosby Show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosby_Show) being perhaps the last consistent intentional advocate for improved black social standing.

With the maturation of the black community in catatonia at best (and possibly in regression), the issues stacked against it persist and grow. Confused public perception. Angst and suspicions. Outright racism. And every single thing I've just listed that depressing about being black today. As it stands, it will never go away.

**Think about this:** whatever was good that once came out of the black community must be drying up. So the "next best thing" becomes the new good thing so that profitability is not lost. The Wire (which I swear I've written about before...), Waka-Gucci-Ross... the plight itself is the new hot. The same way that capitalism takes your money, charges merchants to accept it and you to spend it, someone is looking to profit from us until we become dust.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>His hoodie killed Trayvon Martin as surely as George Zimmerman.</p>&mdash; Geraldo Rivera (@GeraldoRivera) <a href="https://twitter.com/GeraldoRivera/status/182982712934674432" data-datetime="2012-03-23T00:10:53+00:00">March 23, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Meanwhile... here in San Francisco:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>For the record, I've been warning people about the horrors of hoodies for years: <a href="http://t.co/SaaEHd1K" title="http://oopsiedaisy.typepad.com/oopsie_daisy/2010/02/dear-ladies-of-san-franciscoi-was-really-hoping-youd-figure-this-out-on-your-own-that-an-open-letter-of-this-sort-would-not.html">oopsiedaisy.typepad.com/oopsie_daisy/2...</a></p>&mdash; daisy barringer (@daisy) <a href="https://twitter.com/daisy/status/184327104287096835" data-datetime="2012-03-26T17:13:00+00:00">March 26, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

All of which is tremendously depressing. Some innocent kid got shot. Depressing. Some say it was racially motivated. Depressing. Some say it was because his attire was urban (PC for black) and therefore dangerous. Depressing. Some say the glorification of "black culture" is to blame. Depressing. For many black youth, that glorified stereotype is their best chance at any glory at all. Depressing. Meanwhile, for myself and other more successful black people, those we interact with say things like "I don't even think of you as black... you're just you!" Which I guess is well-intentioned but doubly depressing because I AM BLACK and because they're clearly thinking that not considering me black is a compliment.

So this is why I'm perpetually depressed by the state of black america. And to be honest, I'd prefer it if I could avoid having to think about any of these things ever, which is perhaps the most depressing thing of all.

Today is my birthday.

When I was small, a birthday was simple. I'd wake up to my parents and younger sister singing "Happy Birthday," Giving me a funny card, and perhaps some socks or underwear. If I was really lucky, my mom baked a box of cupcakes after I caught the bus and dropped them off to share with my classmates.

Decades later, I still find the ingredients for those early birthdays so appealing. As you grow up the fashionable thing is to make a spectacle of the day, an exception to the rule that is your year, but in this simple form the birthday reminds me of three things:

* **There are people who remember and care for me.** While my parents and sister were not standing in my room singing this morning, they all pinged me in some way. My grandma, the techie of the bunch, sent an email with specially colored font. :) And my left hip is thoroughly massaged from all the text messages, Facebook wall posts and Twitter mentions I'll need to respond to. It's awesome that people took the time to remember and respond--even if they were helped along by social media.
* **There are things I need to make another year.** More than a wild night, for sure. I need focus. I need growth. I still need socks and underwear. Rather than spending my money on a pony or my day in a costume, I prefer to think about the things that make each day of my life great, and [being happy with that](http://www.43things.com/entries/view/2930645).
* **There's nothing better than sharing.** Life is something you can easily race through, from birthday to birthday, until it's done. It's also something you can give, you can receive, and you can share. The interactions we have and the joy that comes from them can be truly euphoric, and while fanfare may be a bit much, no birthday should be recognized in solitude. Friends, coworkers,  even strangers are better than being alone.

Thank you to all of you who make my birthday a day worth living. I wouldn't have made it this far without you.

For those of you who do not play along on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leftsider) or even the few images I've posted on Facebook, I've been vacationing at [Central Pacific Medical Center](http://www.cpmc.org/) thanks to the insistence of my appendix (we've since parted ways). This was my first hospitalization and my first surgery, so I really encountered a lot of new experiences.

From the onset, the staff I encountered were unbelievably amicable and accommodating. Perhaps the combination of poor experiences (taking others to the hospital) and dramatizations on prime time TV left an impression of general hospitalization being function over form, care constrained by capacity. The only exception to this rule was my visit to a relative admitted to the [NIH Clinical Center](http://clinicalcenter.nih.gov/), which benefits from resources and capacity far greater than its demand. I'm not certain of the demand that CPMC serves, but being in the center of San Francisco and open to the public (NIH is clinical research referral only) I expect it to be greater than that found in Bethesda. Additionally, I'm guessing that federal funding levels between NIH and Sutter Health are quite different as well.

Even so, the approach and atmosphere was strikingly similar. People smiled and laughed with you--and each other. Things didn't seem rushed or harried at all (perhaps all Wednesday nights are slow; I don't know). And perhaps it was due to reading [The Checklist Manifesto](http://gawande.com/the-checklist-manifesto) previously, but I loved the overlap that everyone did to make sure that no opportunity for error or confusion could slip in. Everyone confirmed what had been done, and nothing was left for the next person; every vital check happened the exact same way, and every update or change came with a check of my wristband to confirm my identity. It was really bulletproof and made me feel safe.

There's something about living life with precision that is both awe-inspiring and repulsive. I can look at the system in place at CPMC and know that it raises the quality of their care, yet at the same time I can see tons of reasons why any given person would want to skip the routine and just get things done: for a sense of free will, for faster results, and so on. In my personal life as well, I'd love to have this same kind of rote processing but I rebel agains becoming a machine. 

Do we as humans really want perfection? Perhaps we haven't really grasped the concept that optimization reduces the number of viable options available. We, therefore, look at choice as freedom when, in truth, it increases propensity to failure. If someone were truly able to show us the one true Way, [how many would take it](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A13-14&version=NIV)?

So here I sit, in an environment that shows me the real benefits of precision, rebelling against my own efforts to optimize. Yet I'll persist; for this experience has given me multiple points of reset--places where I'll have to stop for a while, start again--that perhaps can be improved. I'm going to have to restrict my activities while I heal; why not reform them as well? Perhaps I'll get to a place where my life is precise enough that I can start focusing on accuracy. Maybe I'll even be able to rid myself of some unnecessary appendages (see what I did there?) along the way.

I am a thirty-something Adventist someone. I have been a regular church attendee all my life, have worked for the Adventist denomination for several years, and even spent time abroad with my wife as missionaries. Still, today, it is not easy for me to be a part of a church community. 

There are significant issues with Adventist presence in the city of San Francisco (I take care not to speak to the presence in the greater Bay Area, of which I'm not informed), but the greatest problem that I face in becoming an active participant in church is not being able to finish what my participation has started. My current life and career require me to be nearly always prepared for relocation; in this globalized world we create for ourselves, situations like this are increasingly common.

Yet even without the threat of leaving abruptly, there are difficulties in leaving projects in progress. My wife and I had just accepted positions in our local church and formed a foundation for the young adult group when we moved to the other side of the country. Before that, leaving our church meant leaving the many kids that called us "kuya" or "ate" (older siblings). And when we left South Korea, even though our leaving was known and planned, things like our english-language Sabbath School class, personal counseling and [rooftop sunset parties](http://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/47835858/in/set-72157603654876387/) were almost certainly doomed to languish, if not die immediately.

I can't be the first person to have felt hesitancy to be involved because I wasn't sure how long I'd be around. And has there been a church that never felt the sting of losing a dedicated church member? Why haven't we thought of a way to ameliorate this painful yet persistent process?

###Every church should operate under a design that accommodates for turnover and attrition. 
New people come in, and old people go. People lose their focus and return with newfound fervor. These undulations create the pulse of a living church, and a body is designed to the rhythm of a heart's beating. Additionally, every church should operate under a design that accommodates for overwork and undercommitment. There may never be a time that all church members exert the same amount of energy; it's the nature of a house of healing. And those who are so dependable, pastors included, are worked to depletion--with no opportunity for rejuvenation. And since not all in a church's community are the same, having one pattern for all church members is unsatisfactory.

In the Bible, the early churches were [established by missionaries, maintained by locals](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philemon%201:1-7&version=NIV) and frequented by brothers/sister of faith as they travelled here and there. As the apostles spread the Christian faith around the known world, [they used letters to encourage and advise](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%203:1-2&version=NIV) the communities they left behind. [They sent their own disciples to check in at a church and help for a bit, and they visited when they could](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians+3&version=NIV). The church was built to accommodate for such fluctuation.

Today, I suggest three concentric circles of an Adventist church: 

* those who form the church community 
* those who improve the church community through participation, and 
* those who espouse the idea of a church community

Those who form the community bear the heaviest responsibility to the church. While even here there may be occasional change, these people have committed not just to the Adventist community but to the *specific Adventist community of a precise location*. The development of the church community in this area, the relation the church community has with the larger community of which they are part, and the longevity of both the community and its relationships are paramount.

Those who are not committed to the specific presence of community of a precise location but are convinced to apply their talent and resources to the development and preservation of the Adventist community wherever they are make up a larger circle that encompasses--with love and support--those who establish and maintain a specific community. Their work improves the church community but are modular additions to the core. In fact, I see this group's approach to the work manifest in a way not unlike agile development. A backlog of needs can be assigned and addressed in short "sprint-like" periods that allow for occasional reorganization as people's involvement levels change. 

Then there are those who support the idea of community. They like going to church, raising their kids in a Christian environment,  being inspired through fellowship and study, and generally thing the whole process has value they can draw from. It is important to note this group as it is the least likely to contribute value to the church. They are courting the community and looking for a reason to take a step of commitment. This group is important not just to keep the pews filled but to provide replacements for outgoing talent--sometimes finding the void left by another enough to convince them to commit. Finally, it provides a buffer for regular attendance without obligation to a specific church role.

###These three circles are anchored with the same center: the physical church building. 
Thus a church is truly a community center--not just a place to hear a good word. With three different types coming in and out of its doors, with differing contributions and varying needs, it cannot be open for a couple hours on a single day of the week but must be a continual place of refuge for those who are seeking comfort, shelter, hope and healing.

With this structure, anyone (myself included) could:

* arrive in a new area and find familiar fellowship
* visit a region for a short period and coordinate opportunities for sharing talent and contributing to a cause
* establish a desire to be involved as well as tentative terms of engagement in case their life plans change.
* acquaint themselves with a new church community without excessive pressure to participate

By providing a method for short term committed individuals to be contributors without being abandoners, for a try-before-you-buy that reduces the barrier for walking into a church, and potential ease of burden for long-standing pillars without relegation, this mimics early Christian church development while accommodating for modern-day obstacles.

Additionally, it allows for a focus that we haven't looked at with much precision: The number of Adventist churches relative to coverage rather than to number of baptisms and membership. For a global church with a membership of 17 million members to have a total active community of 35-50 million is indicative of a church with poised to grow--but that kind of fertile ground is not attainable if our focus is merely on long-term commitment which comes after the baptismal pool and a name on the books. 

We are a global church. We are one community striving to share a message with everyone. This is a process that requires people to actively participate as *active missionaries*, not as merely passive members, and this system of concentric Adventist church community speaks to that need.

My dream of California living involves waking up to a view of the ocean (or, more accurately [@Karlthefog](https://twitter.com/KarlTheFog/)), hopping into my classic muscle car and driving into the city (possibly a combination of [CHiPs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHiPs) and [Bullit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeRwYKi3nws)). And so now that I live in California, I've been spending a lot of time on Fru's iPad using cruising through the San Francisco peninsula via [Trulia](http://www.trulia.com/) and other real estate apps.

It was after sending a cute little home I'd found to my buddy Mark (who *supposedly* is [chronicling](http://castellinoresidence.com/) the renovation of his own sweet find) that I realized **I spend a lot more time looking for opportunities than I do positioning myself to actually take advantage of great opportunities** that may come along. 

*And I'm not just talking about saving for a down payment.*

It's incredible how easy it is to spend our time dreaming instead of doing; wishing instead of working. In fact, it's totally possible to fill your day with things that amount to absolutely nothing--as far as your goals are concerned. Happy hours, [sitcoms](http://blip.tv/web2expo/web-2-0-expo-sf-2008-clay-shirky-862384), and tons of other things that makes time fly and seem worthwhile. Among the million things you can do during your waking hours, few actually put your closer to your goal.

Looking at myself, I found passing interest in so many things that there's no way I could possibly do justice to them all (I may have noticed this before). So I've abandoned my house-hunting pastime, along with other time-eaters, in hopes of focusing my energies on three areas:

1. Generate a consistent, expanding financial base that lend itself to pursuing opportunities.
2. Develop myself personally, establishing a platform of ideas from which I'll stand and be known.
3. Live small--and in a way that is accessible to as many as possible. 

Since then I've tried to whittle down all my daily activity by 10 aspirational principles, in no particular order:

* Spend time outside
* Read and discover mind-expanding things
* Connect with my family
* Travel the world
* Earn my paycheck
* Practice self-mastery
* Live as close to self-sustaining as possible
* Walk with God
* Create things for imagination's sake
* Encourage others to do only what matters

The premise is that anything that does not fall under one of the above is probably not aiding me in my pursuits and should not be done. I hope to find the resolve to make this a permanent barometer in my daily living.

**"How was your weekend? What did you do?"**

Mondays seem to bring about an angst I felt as a kid, returning from winter break. Back then, I was poor country mouse desperately looking to avoid the dreaded question, "What did you get for Christmas?" because, most likely, it wasn't much. That was only once a year; now, in the city of San Francisco, it happens *once a week*.

**"What ya got planned for this weekend?"**

Why do I have to do something every weekend? After a week's worth of working, exercising, eating out and meeting up, sometimes you don't want to do anything. This is known; often times saying you chose to do nothing elicits envy: "Oh! for a weekend where I actually relaxed!"

This has suddenly become ridiculous to me. Perhaps I've put my rose-colored glasses on, but as I recall country folk dont consider every weekend to require exceptional activity. In fact, the weekend was special because it allowed you to catch up on the things that wouldn't fit into the week: the laundry, the yard work, the family, the rest. 

Granted, there weren't as many things to do available in rural settings, to compete with these simpler, ever-present options. But perhaps this is less a concession than an accusation--just having a million activities available in your locale is not an reason to do a million activities. The feverish pitch that arose annually in my youth from the coming of the [Delaware State Fair](http://www.delawarestatefair.com/) seems positively embarrassing in a city where there are seemingly fairs and festivals [every week](http://www.sfheart.com/sfStreet_Fairs.html).

**"Do anything special this weekend?"**

I postit that, precisely, this need for constant "next" and "new" desensitizes us to things of substance, value. We begin to assume the exceptional, erroneously, as the norm--and devalue the things that bring us normalcy, like peace and quiet. Spoken like a true humbug, I guess, but I see it as getting me closer to [my new goals](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2012/08/my-dream-of-california-living.htm) of removing those things which aren't specifically expanding my opportunities and accomplishing my objectives. To be honest, the only benefit I can see for the weekend roller coaster is to be perpetually entertained--which assumes your sitting and watching while everything else works around you.

Perhaps I'll do more by doing less on the weekend. Become a city bumpkin who puts around his backyard, writes a little more often on his blog, gets to his laundry and mail with some consistency. Perhaps people will ask about my weekend less and less, but the time for reflection and renewal will pay off more and more. And who knows--maybe when I do dust of my cosmopolitan shoes it will be to much consternation, shocking the world by going out. :)

BODY:
I'm not sure where I first heard it, but some time ago in discussing/reading Japanese culture I learned how the observance of the new year is different from western norms. This year, I felt particularly drawn to the concept of oosouji ([大掃除](http://jisho.org/words?jap=%E5%A4%A7%E6%8E%83%E9%99%A4&eng=&dict=edict)), which literally translates to "big brush abolish."

It does what it says on the tin. Towards the end of the year everyone--at home, at school, at work; [everywhere](https://www.google.com/search?q=oosouji&hl=en&tbo=u&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ei=qODjUJfpNcrhigKVvYHICw&ved=0CFwQsAQ&biw=1280&bih=679#hl=en&tbo=d&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=%E5%A4%A7%E6%8E%83%E9%99%A4&oq=%E5%A4%A7%E6%8E%83%E9%99%A4&gs_l=img.3..0i24l3.2365823.2365823.0.2367795.1.1.0.0.0.0.146.146.0j1.1.0...0.0...1c.2.FalyM8YA_Nw&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&bvm=bv.1355534169,d.cGE&fp=4428313414e15c1e&bpcl=40096503&biw=1280&bih=679)--starts cleaning, purging and reconciling. While the west has a hazy theme called "spring cleaning," oosouji is intentional: it is the resolving of all old things to make way for the opportunities of the new year. 

Think of it this way, scientist: the [law of conservation of energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy) says that energy can be stored or transferred--not created or destroyed. So if you've got X amount of negative energy and you'd like to replace it with a matching X amount of positive energy, you need to make sure that negative energy gets displaced before the positive arrives.

I like this concept because it encourages both closure and looking forward. It also perpetually puts the coming year and a hopeful and optimistic yet down-to-earth light. My actions and my ability to deal with things directly relate to what opportunities I can take advantage of in the future.

So Fru and I decided, rather belatedly, to try our hand at oosouji. From weeding and cleaning the back yard to hand-washing our front stairs, in the 48 hours before the new year arrived, we went through old magazines, packed up clothes to give away, and got rid of a lot of trash. In the process, I think I learned a few things:

1. **Sometimes you have to let go.** In order for everything to have and end, it has to be abandoned. The thing which you won't let go--be it a sentimental item, an unfinished project or a dream unembarked--is preventing you from claiming new things. It has residual that stays in your psyche and never lets you truly be free.
1. **Matter doesn't matter.** Having stuff around doesn't make it valuable; using it does. 
1. **Closure requires discipline.** Work is sometimes hard to get into; finishing unsavory business seems to always be repellant. Focusing on the task and seeing it resolved is a skill that, left to its own, rusts rather quickly.
1. **It takes tiny gears to make clockwork.** It was a pain to do all that work in such a short time, especially when so much of it would be easily broken in to regular recurring tasks. Developing a system to distribute required effort across many parts helps makes life easier as well as consistently providing opportunity to maintain your resolution skills in small manageable ways.

I'm glad we did it. I'll probably do it again in a year. Until then, I hope for you big things, an ushering in of new blessings and opportunities, and a removal of all un-necessity from your living this year. Let's move forward!

Yesterday I was all set upon being a Californian.

After nearly two years of working and living in San Francisco, I've finally started the process of changing my driver's license. Not that I was very eager to go through the country-wide hassle that is a Department of Motor Vehicles, but because I recently purchased a car. It became necessary for this switch to occur.

I'm not a big fan of California as it regards to motor vehicle administration in general. There's a definite car culture that pervades all but the most urban enclaves (this is not unique to California but is exacerbated by its size). Then there's the fact that traffic citations are ridiculously high: two traffic camera citations for *turning right without a full stop* ended up costing me over $1200.

I've been on the verge of breaking my blogging hiatus for some time, and [Jodi's entry on settling in relationships](http://culturenotebooks.wordpress.com/2013/05/18/settling/) was the final motivator needed to get back into action. Oddly enough, I've talked about this a lot with female friends who perhaps felt a guy's perspective to their conundrum was worth hearing. Perhaps this post will allow me to extend this guy's perspective to a larger audience

My response is simple: *You're only settling if you subscribe to the dream.*

Jodi opens with:

> From a young age, girls of a certain generation and upbringing have been told from very early on never to settle for anything less than perfect when it comes to dating and marriage. We have been told that we deserve a man who is handsome and smart, who can provide, who treats us with respect and love and who would ultimately give us the world, just like in the Disney movies. Lucky are the women who have found such a man. As for the rest of us, our parents' best wishes for us as little girls are simply just that - best wishes for us as little girls.

I agree but think she hasn't taken this reasoning far enough. Women often get disillusioned about Mr. Right, but only after they've fatigued of searching for him. Finding the perfect man is wishful thinking, but so are the general notions of dating and marriage. The truth is that the entire dream needs to be evaluated (perhaps worth [another](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2009/12/love-is-better-than-a-ring.htm) post or two).

If you've talked to me with any regularity in the last 5 years you've likely heard me mention POSIWID--[the purpose of a system is what it does](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does) (I use it *everywhere*). And so this is what happens when I introduced it to a friend in distress:

**She:** All I'm looking for is a (X) guy with (Y) that can love me!

**Me:** Well, the purpose of a system is what it does.

**She:** Yeah...

**Me:** So what is that system--looking for this guy--doing for you?

**She:** Not finding that guy.

**Me:** And also filling your life with stress and disappointment.

This wonderful, successful woman was considering expanding her accomplished career with an international opportunity largely in the hope it would bring her closer to a guy she thought could be "the one." This makes me shudder and cringe with apprehension, but it's not the first (or last) time I've heard of a woman defining life choices by the potential happiness a man could (continue to) provide.

Why would great women in great places look for a guy to make them happy? More specifically, why are they unhappy the great place they're in doesn't match a generic, pre-formatted dream? 

People: **Base happiness upon self and it will attract the right partner.**

We often they hear this too late, wasting our lives looking for the one that will make us "happy" by *completing the equation*. Developing independent, personal happiness redefines what the perfect match is--after all, you can't be certain a person isn't the right match if you haven't confirmed you're in the right shape. I reinforce this #realtalk with Jodi's own entry, which includes an example of what's possible when this happens.

When I met my wife, we were both very young. We also came from very different backgrounds, so we had neither a shared basis or a certainty about our future. I committed to building our relationship based on *us* rather than the norm: this is how others do it, but what works for she and I? While this means that many things were different than others, they were perfectly functional for us. I think this is what allowed us to grow *together* and to stay together as long as we have--at this point nearly seventeen years.

Did we settle? Yes. We settled on a pattern that was customized for us and found happiness in it. We didn't not give up on "happily ever after," because we never actually expected our happiness to come from something other than our own continual efforts. Our independent approach to happiness and our custom approach to relationships seems to have helped us enjoy where we are and what we have for what it is--which means the purpose of our system does what we hoped.

It is my hope that all people can find the system that helps them in the same way.

I think Leftsider has become dormant enough that I can _reset_, taking it back to the old days when it was less formal and more for the moment.

Although it has been quiet, I have been writing. [Medium](https://twitter.com/medium), a new publishing platform from the founder of Blogger (and Twitter!) has been fun to try out. While I ultimately miss the linear connectivity that Leftsider provides, I find good traction for ideas there. I [expressed my concern](https://medium.com/how-to-use-the-internet/581f842279ff) about social networks, [shared a painful reality](https://medium.com/changing-city/e03d9b7481e) of San Francisco living, and [pointed out a few things](https://medium.com/better-humans/62c577f4a06) that others seem to really relate to (over four thousand views!).

If you are here as a faithful feed subscriber or a occasional surfer, I hope you'll find those externally-posted pieces worth your while.

#Happy New Year.

As 2013 came to a close, I found myself focused on deeper, more involved character flaws that have as much right to be called a part of me as anything good or distinctive I might prefer to be known for. And as difficult as it might be to self-evaluate and accept a losing record at addressing these attributes, it is certainly not made easier when you live in what is possibly the most accepting place in the world, working in the most wonderful environment you can imagine on the most ephemeral of things--the tweet.

140 characters is not enough to truly assess and detail the self. It was not intended for this purpose. I find myself occasionally opening a journal and writing (in cursive!) just to slow my mind to the speed of my writing and focus that extra bandwidth on truly investigating my thoughts. A cursory glance through the archives of this blog and you'll know that it once served this purpose; perhaps it should again.

Writing is cathartic; it is also revelatory. Moving back to more regular blogging reinforces my resolve and develops a healthy habit of reflection.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Making resolutions once a year is as effective as eating healthy food once a year or exercising once a year. Consider your plans every day.</p>&mdash; Garry Kasparov (@Kasparov63) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kasparov63/statuses/418024456825483265">December 31, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I look forward to writing again. Perhaps this year I'll be better--through writing--on the other side.

I recently finished "[Making Habits, Breaking Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/816323312)," a book that covers a lot of important points around the habits that make us and define our happiness--good or bad, deliberate or unconscious. It referred to tons of interesting research and experiments around the topic, and tried admirably to make a compelling read of the whole thing.

To save you the effort, let me point out the key takeaways:

 - At the end of the day, mindfulness and awareness of your habits is the key to making and breaking habits.
 - Habits can be good or bad, though we tend to focus on bad habits.
 - Much of what we do in life is due to habit, not personal choice. 
 - It's easier to divert a river than to stop it. Similarly, it's easier to adjust a habit than break it.
 - Habits work best at an unconscious level; there they become automatic. 
 - Habits work best at an unconscious level; as such pleasure from a new good habit diminishes over time.


These are very important things to remember as we work at those seemingly futile resolutions at the beginning of a year. They're also tremendous factors to consider when working to establish a culture. Cultures are often formed entirely around common ritual, and in some cases the act outlives its functional purpose. Even so, we are often reluctant to change our cultural norms, despite the obvious detriment they have on our happiness and well-being.

Lately I've been talking a lot on Facebook (my soapbox of choice) about making mistakes. There are a couple reasons why I feel strongly that making mistakes are the right thing for growth, development and success, and they tie into the themes of this book:

 - The more things go well, the less conditioned we are to making mistakes. We have more opportunity to learn from mistakes than successes, so developing slows when we're good.
 - If we are not in the habit of making mistakes, we become risk averse. For the most part, that's a good survival mechanism. Low risk, however, yields low returns. You get what you pay for.
 - At the end of the day, you're used to what you're currently experiencing. It's often easier to sit and complain than it is to make a mistake in the pursuit of something better. 


I hope to think about things beyond myself, extending to the way my actions (and habits) affect (and take effect) in others. If you were going to create, or improve, the culture around you, what intentions would you implement?

BODY:
For the entirety of this year, I've been considering starting my own church.

Last year, [Micah 6:8](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+6:8&version=NKJV) nailed me to the wall, giving me simple instructions on what I should be doing, how I should be living. It gave me actionable goals: to determine what is just, to practice compassion, and to seek a closer walk with my creator. Never the diligent student, *[ojalá](http://www.interreligiousinsight.org/July2005/July05Ojala.html),* I made progress in these areas regardless. 

But toward the end of the year, and particularly through a re-reading of the book of Genesis, I began to connect to the stories of Abraham, Issac and Jacob in a new and unusual way. Theirs was a relationship that was direct and relatively solitary--they had no church to attend and no pastors to consult. They were not missionaries, nor was proselytizing anywhere close to their focus. Abram relocated based on a conditional promise given by God, but the nature of his work and living did not change. His son, Isaac, grew in the knowledge of that covenant and patterned his life around the God of his father. And while Isaac's son, Jacob had a much more deviated life path, his relationship with God was no less direct, and his prayers were to the God of his father and his father's father.

I found myself developing sympathies with the context of their relationship with God. I, like many these days, have moved away from my "homeland" and find myself and my (very small) family at a distance from my relatives and kin. This holds true from a spiritual standpoint as well. San Francisco has Adventist churches, but [what they offer](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2012/06/concentricity-for-adventist-chur.htm), to be kind, differs from what I received back home; I find myself operating my day-to-day as usual while accepting a greater requirement to make my faith personal, less dependent upon external supports. Perhaps, I realized, there was still a model for me in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchs_(Bible)">the patriarchs</a> that operated in a way that the early Christian churches tend to provide for more traditional frameworks.

# I feel very unqualified to start a church.

I'm consistently shirking leadership responsibility, for various reasons, so it came as no surprise that I'd not want to *be* and Abraham even if that was to be my new model. What did surprise me, however, was the feeling of unpreparedness. I have been Adventist my entire life, without interruption, have spent time abroad as a missionary and worked (off and on) for the denomination, accumulating about seven years of administrative employment. For many, my experiences would already qualify me for a career as a pastor of some sort.

[Ever dependent upon my POSIWID meter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does), I quickly conclude that my denomination's organization--the system--is not designed to output church starters. Much to the smug satisfaction of most detractors to organized religion, it seems my organized religion (and perhaps others) is more designed to create--and more dependent upon--church *members* than church leaders. This was unfortunately confirmed when I shared my considerations with my pastor, who applauded my willingness to follow God's calling but suggested directing my willingness to pre-defined roles within our existing church. She, unwittingly, confided that to lose Fru and I would be to lose something that *the church* really needs. This was her greatest concern.

I wonder if Abram experienced similar. It is very clear that he and his progeny were nomadic for a considerable span of time, but it isn't so clear that the community from which he was from was at all nomadic. In choosing a wife for his son, Isaac, Abraham [directed his servant back to a specific place](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2024&version=NKJV)--which I construe as meaning a permanent location. Certainly some family or friends expressed concern for his leaving the familiar and starting something new.

But there is always something tremendously enriching about seeking out your own. I admit to being inundated by this here in the heart of American speculation. From the Gold Rush to the Silicon Valley to the new tech/startup culture, there is no better place to see people facing the risk of failure in the hopes of attaining new, better, more. To be perfectly blunt, the lessons this provides are almost invariably harsh, with the few stories of success shining bright enough to keep the machine going. Ultimately I believe, tangentially, that at some point (perhaps already passed) the general denizen population regresses to a mean which is not unlike the our forefathers: working a plot of the digital landscape that sustainably provides just enough for ourselves and our small families and (warning: romance) we become wiry and persistent and conservative but deeply faithful and appreciative of what's just, whats merciful and what is deliberately honest, crafted and well-intentioned. 

So I can't say I haven't been influenced by San Francisco. In fact, I blame this city for affecting me in a way that has me asking, for the first time in my life, "Why would I pump my personal efforts and resources into a large, dying system when I, with that same amount of input, could potentially create a viable replacement and see things *persist* beyond the old forms?" The idea of starting my own church is rife with parallels to creating my own startup--perhaps as many as there are parallels to the experiences of the Patriarchs.

# This could all end up badly.

One point worth noting: startups these days are often built with at least one of two goals in mind. They're interested in an end goal that either sees them successful enough to be publicly traded or compelling enough to be acquired by a larger company. I have no interest in being the face of a new religion (or style of existing religion--in fact I'm mortified by the idea of "splintering" or being considered a kooky cult), so my clear option is to make a small product compelling enough that it attracts suitors. I'd see my end goal as a SF Adventist church adopting the model--perhaps as a standalone product that supports its main offering. I guess I could also see it being taken into consideration by a forward-thinking administrative body as a way to augment or pivot to accommodate for [the future ahead](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2009/05/the-biggest-problem-with-relig.htm).

That is if I'm successful. And to be fair, that's a huge "if." I'm not a pastor or spiritual leader--I'm not even, by my standards, a particularly [good person](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2008/07/in-the-garden-of-good-and-evil.htm). I'm just a guy with his own hangups trying to [do right](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2012/08/my-dream-of-california-living.htm) (which is pretty unnatural), appreciate mercy (perhaps through my own failures) and humbly be [intentional about my faith](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2008/02/a-blueprint-for-better-worship.htm). My minimum viable product (startup talk) would be the development a deeper personal relationship with God and deeper personal faith in my own covenant with God--which, when manifested, is strong enough to allow me to persist in a way that isn't unlike Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

So I'm prepping. I'm talking with a friend who's a current bible worker for guidance, and he's pointed me (appropriately) to 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus. He's also pointed me to a book that covers the topic I see as being the "selling point" of my endeavor:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>New reading! /cc <a href="https://twitter.com/kreyne">@kreyne</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/tarrais">@tarrais</a> @ennomueller <a href="https://twitter.com/carpenterale">@carpenterale</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickDillon4">@PatrickDillon4</a> <a href="http://t.co/wxuUUZiRmA">pic.twitter.com/wxuUUZiRmA</a></p>&mdash; leftsider (@Leftsider) <a href="https://twitter.com/Leftsider/statuses/430910342491688960">February 5, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We'll also be doing some small group training, which should come in handy when I'm ready to take this to the streets.

 Finally, I've written this. I hope you'll ping me on Twitter (or write your own blog post!) with comments, concerns, ideas and suggestions.

[As is my custom](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2012/02/change-your-mind.htm), each year* I come up with a new motto or rallying cry for the road ahead. They usually end up as my Twitter bio, and this year's is a bit of a departure from those of years prior. You see, my motto this year (following up on [my last entry](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2014/01/habits-and-mistakes.htm)) is to *make more mistakes*. 

I'm not planning to embark on a life of crime and lawlessness, but I do find three real reasons why I should make more mistakes in 2014:

* **More successes require more failures.** It's a numbers game. If I want to be successful, I need to learn from mistakes and just keep trying as much as possible. The number of people who see sustained success from their first attempts is basically zero, and if you're not failing you probably aren't trying new things. 
* **More mistakes yield less trauma.** If you've never had anything go wrong, you're very likely spending much of your efforts to protect that record--instead of using it to push further. Your first failure can be very traumatic, but your 50th failure is likely to hurt a lot less. Basically an aversion to failure can actually be a major obstacle to actually getting to success. Make sure you're not resisting the cure because you're afraid of the needle. 
* **Mistakes require grace.** When we are on top of the world, it can be easy to be unforgiving of those struggling at the bottom. Falling ungraciously and having to dust ourselves off reminds us that humility and graciousness is well received. It also connects us at a human level to so many more than can be connected to from our untouchable seat of perfection. Making mistakes makes us more dependent on each other and more willing to help others making mistakes. Finally, it speaks directly to the need for a "[finisher of our faith](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12%3A2&version=KJV)." All those haughty Christians must have forgotten that we've all sinned and fallen short--and are in desperate need of grace from our God and from each other. 

So this year, as scary as it may sound, I'll be trying to make more mistakes. At the end of the year I hope to be smarter, better versed, more adaptable and, ultimately, more successful.

*Last year's motto was "Persist." I'm certain I wrote about this, but it seems to have been lost along with [all the other things](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnlLhq1kW10).

I am always a bit disappointed when I hear individuals dismiss the need for privacy or security. "I have nothing to hide," they may say, and consider those fighting for privacy as those who have untoward secrets to protect. For those people, I'd like to take a brief walk through our history as a species. 

Whether you are evolutionist or creationist, one thing that we can agree on is that our origins started us off as a collective. It is not until much later on, and much further in technological advancement, that the idea of being an *individual* really meant anything of value. By yourself, what could you accomplish? Could you procreate? Could you really even manage to do anything more than subsist?

Because humankind required interaction and cooperation, most things were done to the knowledge of the collective. Perhaps religion, taken in the academic sense which I define as "[a codified set of rituals for spirituality](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2009/05/the-biggest-problem-with-relig.htm)," is the earliest example of authority preserved by the protection of information. So we see privacy not being something for all, but something rare and valuable for few. 

The wonderful thing about our societal development is that we've done a pretty good job extending the possibility of privacy to a much larger segment of the population--so far, in fact, that we have undervalued it from its original luxury status to a commodity status, and further. We consider privacy, instead, to be a right: our money belongs to us, our door can be locked, our ideas should be credited. That we can even think of this as such is a testament to human progress. In the end, though, we risk squandering our riches by treating privacy with such casualness.

There was a time when paper was painfully expensive. It was an arduous and manual process to create, so very few people had the opportunity to touch paper, let alone own it. Soon, mechanical processes made paper more abundant and applicable for a variety of uses. They were bound together in things called books, which themselves were quite special and rare. Permit me a small tangent to remind you that at the time the printing press became a thing it was still relatively uncommon anywhere in the world to use paper for toilet purposes [except in China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_paper#History). Today we not only use it to wipe our butts but for just about any other careless activity we can imagine.

Privacy is not like paper. Pretending that there is an overabundance of privacy so great that we can toss it at will results not in large landfills of waste but, frighteningly, an amassing of privilege. Those who choose to hold and manipulate privacy gain heightened authority and/or control when compared to their transparent counterparts. Think about this: *only one who works in privacy can dictate who can have privacy*. This is why we don't share our intimate details with blabbermouths; they don't work in privacy, and thus, are not a place to invest in secrets. When you give up your right to be private, or fail to support the right for others to be private, the end result is that the right to privatize (or publicize) your information is deferred to someone who **does** exercise privacy, and this is where society has found so many of its darker spots.

You don't have to be a bad person to have a secret. You don't have to be hiding something to want privacy. Like income, you don't have to use privacy to justify protecting it. And in our imperfect world, it is very important to remember that any privacy you choose not to protect adds value to privacy elsewhere. 

Treat privacy as the luxury it is, and be careful with it.

There are more sides to bondage and freedom than we care to imagine, and it is often difficult to recognize when we are bound and when we are free.

[There is a story in the Tanakh of a young man named Joseph](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+37%2C+39-45&version=NIV). He was loved by his father more than his brothers, which they resented. He spoke freely and without tact, angering his brothers to the point that they sold him into slavery. As a slave, he became valued for his trustworthiness, but a false accusation saw him thrown into an Egyptian prison. In prison, he correctly foretold the fates of two servants of the Pharaoh's courts, but the one who promised to remember him did not. Eventually, he was remembered, he helped the Pharaoh and became second power over all of Egypt, managing strategy in preparation for an approaching famine. When the famine came, people from the region came to Egypt to buy food--including his brothers. He hides his identity initially and tests their character, but eventually reveals himself, embraces his brothers, and is able to see his father and present his own sons to him before the father dies of old age.

This story contains more glimpses of bondage and freedom than may be recognized at first glance. First, there is the bondage of favoritism and sheltering which prevents one from a true comprehension of social transaction. The ability to discern and to respond are inhibited by the presence of a protective layer between the participant and the unknown. 

We also witness the warping of judgement that can occur when in bondage, no matter how minimal. Joseph's brothers, under the bondage of disadvantageous station, find bearing the license which Joseph is allowed insufferable. They recognize that killing him is wrong, but somehow determine selling him into slavery as acceptable. They also, beyond impulse, design a story for the father that can be considered nothing if not cruel.

The freedom of principle is rich in this story, though it is rarely discussed in these terms. Joseph finds himself in numerous situations, but the one constant that persists is his reputation and integrity. When one is confident in their being, external situations matter so much less to personal perceptions of bondage and freedom. Interestingly, it doesn't really matter whether one is right or wrong, only that they are confident in their perspective and that this outlook serves their need. Consider this the next time you say "Ignorance is bliss."

Least noted of all, in my humble opinion, is the strategic freedom Joseph has to choose his response to his brother's arrival, the tremendous financial freedom he has to improve the fate of his family, and the freedom his heart has to address the present with integrity without dismissing the past. A person of his wealth, capacity and experience could have easily made things very difficult--and would have, by all opinions, been justified. So many of us would have certainly done the right thing, but not with the same perspective. 

> 4 [Then Joseph said to his brothers](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+45%3A4-8&version=NIV), "Come close to me." When they had done so, he said, "I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt! 

> 5 And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you. 

> 6 For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will be no plowing and reaping. 

> 7 But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.[a]

>8 "So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt.

I've been thinking about this story a lot recently, and drawing analogy to personal experiences of the last few years. [In late 2010, I wrote](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2010/11/back-at-zero.htm) about the erosion of a protective financial barrier I'd long been accustomed to. That intentional shielding from once-known realities left me somewhat unprepared for the bumpy ride that was upon me and would persist.

Six months later found us uprooted and transplanted in California, [still trying to live the ideal](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2011/05/how-you-live-where-you-live.htm). Not everyone had the perspective of what I considered ideal; I reached out to those I felt I could trust and ended up being falsely accused. Unlike Joseph, however, I harbored this as betrayal. Perhaps it was because I hadn't fully sorted out [past grievances](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2010/03/the-kind-of-man-i-am.html), but I turned inward, committed to solving my issues on my own; I had begun creating my own bondage.

The person who referred me left Twitter, leaving zero people who knew who I was or who had the ability to remember what I was capable of. Poor freelancing practices left our household severely owing to the government. But a conversation I had with someone gave me a mantra to cling to: "infinite patience yields immediate results." I set my resolve to see these burdens through. 

I watched as this wore me down and warped my perspective. Rather than thinking about what mattered to me, I focused on restitution and return on effort. I focused on the differences around me and the distances to what it was that I wanted. I didn't discover, I didn't explore, nor did I wonder; my heart turned to stone and my jaw was set in silent defiance. [I chose a freedom from the things which would make me feel](https://twitter.com/farnamstreet/status/478345095495041024).
 
And so, in May, when I sold a few shares and used the proceeds to pay the last of tens of thousands of dollars owed, I lifted my head a free man for the first time in over three years. But it wasn't until I ran into that post, written years ago, that I realized what I was actually free from--that bondage I'd placed upon myself. In an email correspondence I noted, "As [the ability to sell shares] drew closer, it seemed my misery was increasing, but I've realized it's my heart--hoping that I can be me again. Who knows if I'll ever fully be me again, but for once, tomorrow is open--and free."

So I think about Joseph, his strategic and financial capacity, and his ability to present his ideal to those who he fully recognized as orchestrating his past experiences. That I could be as great, as benevolent; that I could truly return to a world of honesty, craftsmanship, good intent--and nothing else. That will determine whether I am truly bound or free.

BODY:
We've recently moved to a new apartment. It's a bit far from San Francisco, but its location is attractive. Even so, Frulwinn noted that this is the fourth place we've lived since we moved to California in March of 2011. 

I understand her weariness, but I'm not as beleaguered. In fact, I feel I'm getting closer to finding what it is I didn't know I was looking for. I'll explain. 

While it's easy to connect dots in hindsight, I can't help but feel God's providence in how things have turned out. I had no idea that moving to work at Twitter would provide the only way I'd be able to pay off taxes we'd incur. I'd never have developed the friendship I have with Tav, Fru's cousin, if we hadn't lived together and formed that bond. Had we not moved from there to Daly City, I might not have begun wandering Pacifica's coast and falling in love with California's natural beauty, nor would I have had the space and solitude to consider my experience as a [journey of self-development, strengthening me for self-sufficiency](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2014/02/contemplations-on-personal-spiri.htm). Even today, as I spent a little time in the Marin Headlands, I came to a fuller awareness of an actual love for California that has been stunted by my difficult relationship with San Francisco. 

Thus, finding ourselves living 20 minutes north of where we first started, outside of San Francisco, feels an awful lot like circling around and honing in on the target. I think a lot of life is accepting that everything happens for a reason, determining if that reason is discernible and understanding how long it will take us to discern.  I believe we are in California for a reason. That's a new wrinkle I'm trying to make more sense of, and making sense of it means being somewhat available to gaining new perspectives.

So this move, as with all the others, is a good one--driven by progressive positioning and a desire to better ourselves. I hope it will teach us even more about who we are, what we need, and where we should be. Rather than find a place and conform to it, as so many others, I am committed to finding the place we need to be and that fits us. Luckily, we're one move closer than before.

I've recently begun meeting with a mental heath professional. While I'd been considering it for years, I think the realization of how great a burden I placed on my mind and heart while dealing with financial issues convicted me of the need to just talk out things with someone. 

Truth be told, I've needed to talk things out for a while. These years in California have not been my most social or successful (because I don't consider my net worth as an indicator of success). They've been hard, and the few people who I do trust enough to share with candidly are in the wrong place. But even before we moved west, I still wished for someone to confide in.

I've not yet confided fully with my therapist, but trust takes time. We've started to build a rapport, and that's important. I'm not in any particularly stressful situation right now, so it's an opportune moment to set the foundation properly--and it's only now I'm realizing how important that is. Haste makes waste, and I fear I've wasted more opportunities for developing relationships in the past few years than I should have. 

In the end, I'm not looking for a breakthrough so much as a clean plate. An opportunity to exist with minimal cognitive overhead--having worked out and documented my foundational principles, I increasingly use those models to manage the reduction of things clogging my mind--little things that should be easily handled. I'm hopeful that this mental health practice, along with physical and spiritual practice, will result in a great leap forward towards the optimized me.

I recently read [Meditations](http://www.amazon.com/Meditations-New-Translation-Modern-Library-ebook/dp/B000FC1JAI), and really enjoyed it. Of the many admonitions I drew from its pages, this was the greatest challenge put forth:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Perfection of character: to live your last day, every day, without frenzy, or sloth, or pretense. --Marcus Aurelius</p>&mdash; leftsider (@Leftsider) <a href="https://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/508811768714760192">September 8, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I've been fascinated by the working parts in this suggestion, hoping I can get them all reflected in my daily living.

* **Live your last day, every day.** This is the hardest to execute, as so much of our living is based on the pretext of another day coming. Buying groceries, making plans, seeing projects through to completion. But the crux of this concept, if I understand it correctly, is to bring to resolution as much as possible each day until each day could be your last day. Perhaps there will still be food in your refigerator and plans incompleted on your actual last day, but will you have lived without regret? Will there be nothing that you are sad to leave outstanding or undone? Perhaps you should do those things now, as tomorrow really isn't promised. 
* **Without frenzy.** Much of today's life, it seems, is about hoping from one whirlwind to the next. Multitasking your life away at work, juggling anything that comes your way. Keeping romance aflame through activity and spontaneity. Partying aggressively with wanton abandon and living in the moment. At first glance this may seem to satisfy the "live your last day, every day" challenge, but in truth this constant chasing and grasping, however earnest, is of little substance. The opposite of frenzied is calm, ordered, and systematic. Perhaps it is impossible to make such sense of the world at large, but we can through practice make our actions less furtive and reactionary, more measured and reasonable.
* **Or sloth.** This one is self-explanatory. While downtime is necessary, there's not a person in the world who hasn't felt that they could have used a segment of time more productively. Again, this is something that comes with practice; a working into the fibers of our being a disposition for active thinking and doing. In the same way that authors are encouraged to write a page a day if they ever hope to accomplish the novel, we too should fight laziness daily if we hope to accomplish our life dreams. 
* **Or pretense.** If it really were your last day, would you still care if people talked about your outfit? Whether your car matched your position in life? Whether your business card correctly displayed your credentials? Would you still not tell that person you loved them for fear of rejection? So much of our lives exists in a state paralyzed for the order and form of society. Screw that. Live to better yourself and to improve your community. If it doesn't hurt society, it doesn't hurt you. Sure it may bruise your ego, and your pride may be shattered, but those things were restricting your anyway. Live with sincerity.

So yeah, trying to keep all of those in mind on a daily basis is a challenging endeavor. But I think it's an effort worth striving for, a character worth obtaining.

###[PAPERMAG: NO FILTER: An Afternoon With Kim Kardashian](http://www.papermag.com/2014/11/kim_kardashian.php)

Yes you've seen/heard about the photos. Read the article.

No wait; go back and _read the article._ I'm so very impressed by it. I think it's the second most profound thing I've read today ([here's the first](https://adventistbiblicalresearch.org/materials/theology-heaven/marriage-heaven)).

> "There's nothing we can do that's not documented, so why not look your best, and amazing?" 

If you'd told me I'd be pondering the brilliance of Kim Kardashian quotes, I'd likely ask if you'd unwittingly started following [Kim Kierkegaardashian](https://twitter.com/KimKierkegaard). But here we are, looking at a one-two punch delivered in a flippant comment. 

* **There's nothing that we can do that's not documented.** I blog my thoughts, Tweet my reactions, Instagram my meals, share media on Facebook, rate my media on Netflix and my places on Yelp. But even beyond that Comcast tracks my watching habits (and, perhaps my surfing habits as well), Rdio tracks my listening activity, Google--via Android--tracks my location, my searches and my schedule. Increasingly, there is nothing I can do that isn't recorded, documented, or at least noted. And I'm not even remotely qualifying as a celebrity.

* **So why not look your best, and amazing?** Are we practicing mediocrity, or are we establishing excellence? To have an "on" and "off" state for our awesomeness means, POSIWID, that we accept less than our best from ourselves. Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying we won't fail, make mistakes, or fall short. But what I am saying (and realizing personally) is that not striving for the top means I _always_ end up with failures, mistakes and shortcomings, and that whatever I do--whatever I end up with--is documented forever, if not by social media and big data by the impressions I make on others. 

The article picks up on this brilliant perspective: 

> To mere mortals who occasionally visit the grocery store in yoga pants, her willpower and self-discipline are a marvel. Imagine being filmed and photographed constantly, yet never saying anything seriously controversial or appearing unkempt. The effort involved seems torturous, impossible. And yet, though her life requires work of a sort -- roughly two hours of hair and makeup each day, regular meetings for her assorted businesses, wardrobe fittings, photo shoots, 5:00 a.m. workouts -- you don't get the sense that she is hiding or suppressing her true, private self. 

> [...]

> We're accustomed to our performers having onstage and backstage registers, but for her there is no division between the two. This is, indeed, the definition of a reality star. She's not performing, that is -- at least not visibly. She is being, and being is her act. Her appeal derives from her uncanny consistency, as does that of her show. 

I never thought that I'd be slapped in the face by the work ethic of a reality star, but, as the article notes, she has a clothing line, a makeup line, a line of tanning products and a line of perfumes. She also has a game app that has reportedly earned $43 million since it launched in June. And me, well, I've got...

OK, Kim. I may not be able to break the internet, but I'll make a serious effort to break my own barriers.

Reading the most recent issue of Foreign Affairs magazine, I have been presented with a lot of discussion around what generates innovation, and whether that is good overall for economy. It would seem that all the people that were interviewed seem to think innovation is something to be encouraged. They also seem to think that the entrepreneur is critical for that to happen. 

It makes sense. Every person who starts a business is learning as they grow. To some extent, things have to be experienced more as an entrepreneur. Often there's little (or no) roadmap, and very often there's failure. But these are the things that give you business wisdom, and allow you to create something new--to find a solution that hasn't been found before. As long as your copying the pattern you'll never find your own shape. 

I've been wondering if that extends to spirituality. It would certainly seem that the opportunity for failure is much higher were one to try and identify correctness in their existence without some framework to guide them. But how often do those of any religion find themselves adhering to a shape that is not only unnatural but also non-essential--merely a construct turned into a rule itself. Would it make sense for one to strike out and embrace a more mystic method?

I've been toying a lot with the idea. We'll see if the new year brings a grand opening.

Life comes at you, whether fast or slowly, and it's really hard to understand the nature of things in their occurrence.

When we were children, we were under the governance of others and, thus, had no real sense of the source of order in the world--only instructions to follow. As more autonomy became ours, we struggled to make our way, likely finding ourselves rebelling against most things indiscriminately. Only as we approach adulthood are our questions of "why is this happening to me?" really supported by a sincere interest in knowing the nature of things.

Perhaps this is because we've finally accepted that the world does not revolve around us; rather, it would seem, it currently revolves around every living thing in existence  (and maybe a few things not in existence). This seems unnatural, perhaps because it is; what species does not share a common purpose, common interests, mutual threats?

So I confess I'm not sure how to feel about things right now. Technology and innovation is rooting out humanity's most dire issues, but not without a cost. Our cultural diversity--necessary to explore all possible solutions--wanes when an answer is found. The beautiful "differentness" of humans, which I love, seems to be fading; perhaps our generation is the last to have the opportunity to observe this wonder outside of a curated, preservationist presentation (or perhaps it was the generation before...).

I know how I feel about this loss, but I can't help wonder if it's just me again striving to have the world revolve around me. Would our species be better off if we jettisoned our differences and revolved around our commonalities? Does it matter what those commonalities are? Can I be happy with a world inhabited by, say, a peaceful and protected race of insipid, self-interested, gaudy and unlearned revelers?

Perhaps the dread I feel is not for what the world might become, but for a growing realization that this world isn't mine and is not designing for my tastes--nor was it ever.

BODY:
As in previous years, I've selected a theme for 2015. Most years I've grasped this concept quickly and with little editing, but this time I've had to work a little harder, taking the time to get it right. 

In the later stages of last year, I was nearly certain it would be "Digital Monasticism." I was experiencing a distillation of interests, a sinking of things that were frivolous combined with a increased desire for things of substance, that seemed to be leading to an accepted withdrawal from popular circles. I felt okay with it, though, because of the technological tools that were at my disposal. 

A generation or two ago committing one's self to the pursuit of truth or justice or betterment was an isolating affair; most occupations would take too much resource to allow for your pursuit, and most societal arrangements were too distracting. In this age I am given a laptop, a portable work device, to work on the internet, a globally accessed medium, recognizing that what I do--and am paid well for--can be done anywhere, at anytime. 

For example, I'm in Ireland right now using said machine with no issues. My manager lives here; we usually meet each other regularly via video conferencing. The difference between now and the usual is that we have a few more unscheduled conversations and we get to share a few meals. For me to do my job however, there's little difference if I'm in Dublin, Ireland or Dublin, California--or Dubai, for that matter. 

I also have this Internet. Unlike those of old who sought to understand more fully, I really do have access to a tremendous amound of material that will be useful in the pursuit. My time would be better spent in restricting, rather than procuring, what I'd need to study. And with this trusty old blog I can document my findings. Twitter and Medium, among others, may have some involvement it the publishing process as well.

But in discussion, both conversational and therapeutic, I came to a fork in the proverbial road of my thought: If I had to choose between a clear and concise understanding of truth or a deep and effective understanding of others, which would I choose? The few people I surveyed in this all chose the latter, and I understood their logic. I wondered if I was losing something, something that kept me connected to humanity. I ultimately decided that conservatism would be my approach for now, and that removing myself from the world, being seen only by the works I publish would be more extreme that conservative. 

And so I wrestled with the slogan for 2015. I knew what I wanted, but I needed a new approach. This was more work that I had previously given to the tradition, so it was a bit off-putting. Even so, In fits and spurts, I mulled it over, contemplated the extrication of monasticism from what it was I actually wanted. 

In the meantime, I'd long adopted as a professional motivator one of Twitter's core values: Be Rigorous, Get it Right--and the more I thought of it, the more it really was what I wanted. I wanted to do what it takes to get things right; correcting my perceptions, my actions and [so on ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path).

So this year I'll be taking the time to get it right. I'm already better for the time I've applied thus far.

BODY:
It's not that I fall in love too easily, because I'm not falling in love with people, but that looking at someone long enough will yield something I find admirable, novel or incorrigibly cute. 

I consider this a virtue, not a flaw. Yet perhaps my greatest foundational dissonance arises from this facet of my being: I live--half expecting, half hoping--for others to see me and find me charming, novel, or noteworthy. Perhaps when I was younger, when youth is its own attractor, this worked--certainly it brought me to where I am today. But as I grow older, I perceive my value as diminishing; I see fewer people falling in love with me.

Expanding outward, the people who I will always consider most like me--the people who grew up like me and to some extent look like me--don't have a good reputation either. This bothers me. They live, they smile; they struggle, they persevere. They win some and lose some and live and die and love and hate; what did they do in their life that made them less endearing to others? They had little, they have little, they'll likely end with little; is their material domain the reason for their ostracizing? 

If so, what can I do to expand their material domain? How can I raise their social worth to a level that gives them a level opportunity to be assessed, rather than being an exception to a general consensus--as I often feel I am. Making it personal again, how can I raise the reputation of those like me, thus increasing my opportunity to be loved again, just for being me?

This is the first problem I want to take the time to get right. I'll take the time to talk through the problem, ensuring its definition is accurate. Then I'll explore ways to address the issue, hopefully using the most effective solutions toward righting the situation. 

Something big is what I'm after now, what I'm living for.

[The Next Great Migration - NYTimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/opinion/sunday/the-next-great-migration.html?_r=0)

> Watching what happened in Ferguson, Mo., and Staten Island and knowing that blacks are 21 times more likely than whites to be shot by the police constitute a heavy psychological tax.

In this piece, Mr. Williams suggests that perhaps black Americans should consider some time apart from their home country. I'd be lying to you if I said I didn't have the exact same thought during those bleak months ending 2014.

> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>What&#39;s the best country for a person to live a life where all people are treated equally regardless of ethnicity or class? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Askingforafriend?src=hash">#Askingforafriend</a></p>&mdash; leftsider (@Leftsider) <a href="https://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/537331935367168002">November 25, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Replies arrived of varying types, petering out as Twitter discussions usually do, but I've never stopped thinking about whether my time in the United States has reached its expiration date--a thought that had never entered my mind, even in my time living abroad. On the surface, it *is* about escaping that psychological tax. But that's the beginning; where the impetus starts. Moving from that central theme outward, we find, as James Baldwin wrote (and the author quoted), "the sanction, if one can accept it, to become oneself."

> "The race situation back home occupies so much space in your mind, even just safety-wise, I actually never fully understood what it meant to be American, and all the advantages that come with it, until now." There are subtler satisfactions, too: "You immediately remove that affirmative action target from your back. A work visa gives you the validation that you're good at what you do."

What prosperity of the black American can be realized in an environment steeped in ostracization, fear and inferiority? Such an environment, paired with the oft-heard call to repair one's own reputation, create the most vicious of cycles. What if we could break that by just...going away? Stepping further, how could there not be benefit from black Americans seeing the world--not just Paris but Caracas, Rabat, Seoul, Warsaw, Jakarta--and returning, indelibly changed? 

I currently cannot imagine a better way to both free a black American from cultural stigma and expand their global perspective than to leave the US--not permanently, but longer than a vacation. And I wonder what negative effect could possibly lie beyond that horizon.

BODY:
Fru and I are reading the Bible, a chapter at a time, in our evening 
worship. We recently finished the four-chapter book of Ruth, and my 
first reaction was:

> "Why isn't this called the book of Boaz?"

For those of you unfamiliar with the story--a brief recap: God promised 
Abraham that a great nation would come from his line. His grandson, Jacob, 
had twelve sons and changed his name to Israel. After 400 years of 
servitude to the Egyptians, the cries of the children of Israel were heard 
by God, who remembered his promise to Abraham. Freeing them from bondage 
through Moses, they set off for the land he promised to Jacob. 
Rehabilitating them along the way, the land the finally reached was divided by the twelve 
tribes of Israel--each tribe coincidentally named after Israel's twelve sons. 
The people were generally grateful to God but his presence struggled 
to be more than a part of their history; they often found themselves 
adopting the belief systems and deities of the surrounding nations. 

Still with me?

So one guy moved away from the Israelite states into an area called 
Moab. He and his wife settled there and had two sons, who married 
Moabite women. Unfortunately the man and his sons died--leaving 
three widows. The mother-in-law, Naomi, urged her daughters to go back 
to their people, hoping they might still be able to remarry. One 
reluctantly agreed, but the other, Ruth, insisted on staying. She went 
with Naomi, who returned to the land of her people and where she might 
have better fortune. 

In those days, there were a lot of rules to ensure people were cared 
for. Land owners, for example, were charged not to make a second pass 
in their harvesting, but to leave the missed grain behind for the widow 
or the orphan. Also, if a man died without a male descendant there would be 
no one to inherit his share of the tribal possessions. For this reason, 
a son-less widow was to be remarried to a kin to her husband, who was 
responsible for her. This kinsman not only took in the widow but also 
was to have kids with her, redeeming that family's line.

Ruth asked her Moabite daughter-in-law to go after the harvesters and 
collect grain for their provisions. The field she happened to choose 
belonged to Boaz, a kinsman of her late father-in-law. He regarded her 
with kindness, wishing the Lord's wings of protection to cover Ruth, her
mother-in-law, and even asking his harvesters to leave a little extra for 
her to pick after them. Naomi naturally went into matchmaker mode and 
hoping that Ruth might catch more than just his favor! 

When the harvest was done, usually the landowner and his harvest men
slept on the threshing floor with the grain to protect against theft.
It subsequently became a time of male camaraderie and revelry, my 
study Bible says. Naomi convinced Ruth to dress up practically like a 
bride and sneak onto the threshing floor after Boaz had had his fill 
of wine and had fallen to sleep away from his men. She instructed her
to uncover his feet and to sleep next to them. Naturally, when the wine
wore down and he felt his blanket not on his feet, he looks down to see
Ruth sleeping there. He asks her why she is there, and she (perfectly)
expresses her wish to be cared for by him, asking him to extend the 
corner of his blanket to cover her (a tongue-in-cheek reference to his
exact wish that God would protect her with his wings). Boaz, semi-drunk 
and totally impressed by the bold yet noble behavior of Ruth, promises
to sort out the situation the next day. He give her some more grain and 
sends her on her way before anyone would discover her there.

The situation, it turns out, was that he was second in the line of
kinsman who could redeem Naomi's family. In the morning he found the 
kinsman ahead of him and, in the presence of the elders, made him aware
of Naomi and Ruth's need. The kinsman recognized Boaz's report and gave
intent to do this kinsman-redeemer duty. Boaz slyly implied, however that there was a 
lot of responsibility, particularly in the way of producing an heir 
(it seems perhaps this kinsman may have already been married?). Citing
risk to his existing estate, he demurred, and suggested perhaps Boaz could
take the responsibility in his stead, to which Boaz humbly agreed.

The day was saved, Ruth and Boaz were married, Ruth had a son named Obed,
who carried on the family line, having his own son named Jesse, who just 
so happens to be the father of David of the "David and Goliath" story 
(and whose line goes all the way to the earthly parents of Jesus). 

A lot of people like this story; it's like the Bible's own medieval fairy
tale. I've always heard it told with such emphasis on the romance between
Ruth and Boaz, but to be honest I didn't see romance at all when reading it
directly. What I saw basically consisted of two destitute women using the 
only things they had--their brains and their charm--to survive, and a man 
who went out of his way to redeem two hopeless-yet-sincere people with 
exceptional character. Actually, if there was any person in the story whose 
character was to be imitated, I'd say it was Boaz--hence my original 
question: Why is this book named after Ruth and not after him?

I'd love to be a kinsman redeemer; I'd love it more if everyone tried to be 
one in their own way. Restoring peace and safety in the lives of those 
in misfortune, lending power and support to the disadvantaged, making it 
our responsibility to see the lives of others continue comfortably. In fact, 
Boaz went above and beyond the call of duty by taking responsibility for a 
situation that he was under no obligation to fix; remember there was 
another who was actually the person to take responsibility. It's a 
very god-like benevolence, and I can't help but think of the Christ 
himself teaching, preaching, healing and helping. In fact, Jesus *is* the 
*ultimate* kinsman redeemer. He is not a chip off of Boaz's block; Boaz, 
rather, is a glimpse at what our Redeemer is really like.

> If Jesus is our Boaz, then Ruth is us.

The book may be named after Ruth because she represents us, reflects us. 
We can find ourselves in dire situations with totally busted plans. We 
may even be a foreigner to the concept of a kinsman redeemer, just following 
the instructions of someone who does. But if our heart is sincere and our 
purpose is true, He will count our faithfulness as righteousness and 
reinstate us through his unmerited favor towards us. 

The book of Ruth is about someone like us; it's my book. 
I think that's kind of cool.

One thing is certainly true; the length of time between posts to Leftsider has little to do with available time. It has much more to do with an aversion to anything in the long form: reading, writing, and even watching--whether live or cinematic.

It's as if my brain has now been hand crafted for the 140-character Tweet, the persistent notification and the instant gratification. Unlike those southern residents who were seemingly content to exist without objective, Even that with a plot falls if it doesn't catch me quickly. 

I worry about this. I worry about what I'm sacrificing in order to flourish in the moment. I wonder if there are [larger effects](http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/feb/18/is-twitter-bad-for-economic-growth-bank-of-england)  that aren't being considered. 

Most of all I wonder if I'll ever get all the things in my head out and onto this blog.

I recently spent a few days in Las Vegas, Nevada, to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of a lovely couple. I met a few new people, and during that time we strangers engaged in lots of activities--one of which was driving dune buggies around on fifteen thousand acres of Nevadan desert.

<a href="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/assets_c/2015/06/11351278_856950224341168_834495024064857855_n-75.htm" onclick="window.open('http://leftsider.com/leftsider/assets_c/2015/06/11351278_856950224341168_834495024064857855_n-75.htm','popup','width=960,height=720,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://leftsider.com/leftsider/assets_c/2015/06/11351278_856950224341168_834495024064857855_n-thumb-500x375-75.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="11351278_856950224341168_834495024064857855_n.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a>

It was a great experience--expensive, but highly recommended--but there's one thing about the experience I can't seem to let go. The man who picked us up from the hotel, the old dude who later drove us into the desert, and the young guy that was our guide all said the same thing to us:

> *You've paid good money to do this; drive it like you stole it.* 

At first, I chuckled it off. The concept of [joyriding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vehEW64WbrQ) popped into my head, but the only thing I could really imagine was wrecking a car hard enough that the airbags deployed--not all that fun at my age. I chalked it up to their way of saying "don't be afraid to [drive fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mdhsj2nZnU)."

You see, we had paid for a "chase." In that situation, each person has a dune buggy of their own, and they chase the guide's buggy. Doing it this way means that you set the tone; the only reason the guide will slow down is because he is waiting for you to catch up. Conversely, if you are right on his bumper, it's a signal to him that he can crank it up yet another notch. Driving fast means more excitement for your buck; driving like you stole it means the price would be a bargain. 

Once I got out there and got a little more comfortable with the dynamics of my buggy, the admonition hit me again: sure I was driving a bit fast, but was I driving it like I stole it? I gave myself a bit more license to drift on corners and scale dune walls, but I still felt like something that could be free was still locked in somehow.

Then it hit me: I wasn't on a road. This wasn't a car. There were no speed limits, street lines or right of way rules. The encouragement to drive like it was stolen wasn't for me to drive like I was on the other side of the law--it was, at least for me, a mental aide to get me to understand a space where laws and constraints don't exist. Illegality is likely the nearest concept as most people, self included, rarely get to glimpse free [agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_%28sociology%29). I think I did on that day, and it was awesome.

We had our fun in the 100+ degree sun and headed back to The Strip, but I couldn't stop thinking about this experience of [free play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_play_%28Derrida%29) I'd just had. In true Leftsider fashion, I began extrapolating... wondering just how much of my life was being operated under limits--particularly those limits which, like my driving in the desert, were self-imposed. 

A week has passed and I'm still looking at my life through the eyes of this experience and thinking of ways I can expand my existence; not to live life as if I had stolen it but to live with the minimum number of limitations.

BODY:
Friday was my last day at twitter.

It's hard to write anything but generalizations about a four-year, four-month experience. So allow me to shape, before your eyes, my formal response to my time.

> Twitter was the biggest mistake of my life.

There was a time I really thought this. About eighteen months in, I was being graded poorly on a job I really disliked and wasn't really good at. My manager was receiving platitudes from other teams about other work I was doing, but it wasn't reflecting in my feedback. I was basically told to improve at something I wasn't good at if I wanted to be allowed to apply for other opportunities in the company. I felt trapped, with no one aware of my skills or all that interested in my development. 

I had no network, but I started thinking about where I wanted to go next. I'd set the end of 2012 as my exit window, one way or another. Then, suddenly, I was given a single opportunity with another team. I jumped, and worked like crazy to prove to myself that my capacity was greater than the space I'd been given. Long story short, I found a team much more amenable and supportive, and I ended my time at Twitter largely working at the same level I'd been when I'd left my last employer four years earlier.

> Twitter was the most profitable mistake of my life. 

Regardless of how you feel about working *at Twitter,* it's undeniable that everyone you'll meet in the US, much of Asia and most of Europe will have heard about Twitter. When asked where I worked, I'd simply say, "...at a tech company." If pressed for a name, the incredulity in people's faces when I finally spilled the name was amusing. "Oh! Just a tech company!" "Ha! As if I've never heard of it!" and so on. I've never worked at a place so universally known, and likely never will. 

For all that was restricting me in company, working for Twitter granted me a lot of cachet outside of work. People wanted to talk to me about getting into big tech companies, wanted to confide with me their great new idea, wanted me to advise or recommend to their constituents. I felt woefully unqualified for much of this, and it made me wonder if other people who'd been branded mentors, thought leaders and consultants ever felt the same way. 

Meanwhile, working at Twitter meant that I had three free meals available to me four days a week (there was no dinner served on Fridays). And by "free meal" I mean a dozen different meal options of which I could choose any or all. There were additional kitchenettes on every floor with snacks, drinks cereal, coffee and fresh fruit. There were baristas who served coffee. There were game rooms with pinball machines, basketball hoops, gaming consoles, ping pong tables, arcade games and Foosball. There was a wifi-enabled rooftop deck with lawn chairs and artificial grass (originally we has twitter-themed blankets for the lawn but they were quickly stolen). We had free yoga classes, free Pilates classes, free Crossfit classes, free improv classes; discounted body work by in-house masseuses and occasional acupuncturists. Additionally, we had a benefit of $100 towards any fitness or gym membership we'd signed up for. We had in-house showers with soap, shampoo and conditioner, and even our general bathrooms were stocked with toothbrushes, toothpaste and floss picks. More than once I noted, in commiseration with others, that there was no better place to be until you found the place you actually wanted to be.

While starting in a low role initially meant a bit of a pay cut, I was clearly no longer in the capped environment of a religious non-profit, and pay increases came--especially after transferring from Support to Localization. The job I'll take in August will pay me roughly 30% more than I was just making, but even that was 50% more than my starting income. And then there's the equity I earned working in a company that would later go public. An entirely, new thing for me, I found myself in possession of highly-valued stock and was able to [find a bit of financial freedom](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2014/06/bondage-and-freedom.htm) as a result. I will forever be grateful to Twitter for all of this. 

> Twitter was the hardest lesson I've ever learned.

I've always been blessed and highly favored. I do not have an attitude of persistence and perseverance, largely because my greatest opportunities have appeared, *deus ex machina*, throughout my life. I've been a lover, not a fighter, and the experience of Twitter was rougher than anything else I've ever undertaken. As I've considered the sum of my time at Twitter, ignoring the emotional flare-ups and bruised egos, what I find is a true reflection of my character and the distance between who I am and who I imagine myself to be. I see obstacles I sat and pouted in front of instead of overcoming, and I see my first real efforts at facing adversity. 

I witnessed passion and optimism side by side with burnout and hopelessness, and was given the opportunity to choose where I wanted to be. In March, when I found myself being very cynical about relatively minor things, I noted my position and ultimately decided that I'd rather be somewhere else than to be an obstacle to passion and optimism. And that's ultimately why I left; I'd learned enough to sense that changes were occurring within Twitter and within me as well that made moving on and leaving that which I'd finally come to understand in order to continue growing in the next unknown the only reasonable option. 

> Twitter might have been just the beginning. 

We'll see. As I take some time to relax before the next opportunity, I wonder if I can ever leave Twitter behind--or even if I should. Its indelible impressions are really what make me ready to take on what's next, and I think I'll just have to accept it for that, knowing that what I get myself into next is likely going to be no less challenging.

BODY:
As the year closes, I find myself thinking about space. 

I ended up reading several science fiction books this year. What I realized this morning is that I've spent a recognizable chunk of the year considering the logistics of space travel.

[The Martian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian), which later became a successful movie, spent time considering Mars--getting to it, getting back to it, and getting off of it. [Consider Phlebas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8935689-consider-phlebas?from_search=true&search_version=service), the first of Iain M Banks' Culture series, has the protagonist entering and exiting multiple planets and solar systems with varying methods and levels of success. (I also read [Player of Games](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18630.The_Player_of_Games?from_search=true&search_version=service) and [Use of Weapons](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12007.Use_of_Weapons?from_search=true&search_version=service) (highly recommended!), which are the next two books in the series, but in general I think Banks spends more time in the culture (duh) than in space). [Seveneves](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22816087-seveneves?from_search=true&search_version=service) talks nearly exclusively and extensively about things in orbit or crossing earth's orbit with the moon. Chinese author Liu Cixin dazzled me with [The Three-Body Problem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem?from_search=true&search_version=service) and its sequel, [The Dark Forest](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168817-the-dark-forest?from_search=true&search_version=service), which tells of Earth's response to the threat of extraterrestrial invasion--I expect the trilogy-concluding Death's End to be my first book completed in 2016.

All this said, I've learned four things about this kind of travel. 

1. *Nearly all energy expended in space travel is to escape gravity.* The NASA spacecraft we easily envision is attached to enormous rocket thrusters which propel astronauts into space with a force that exceeds gravity's pull. 

3.  *How much energy is expended is proportional to how much you're carrying.* As soon as they get into orbit, they jettison those big things because hauling around empty weight is going to limit how far you're going to be able to go. 

4. *Travel is limited by how much propulsion you have.* Since we haven't come up with perpetual machines, space travel depends on how much you have in the tank. And if that's the case, you have to conserve for a round trip or accept a one-way ticket.

2. *Everything is a path.* Once you've run out of fuel (or you've just stopped thrusting) you don't just stay in place; you'll continue moving whether you want to or not. You'll either keep your current trajectory, or lesson number one kicks back in. Whatever gravity is around will have its way on you and you'll follow the trajectory it takes--whether in a circle like the moon or on a far-reaching arc like a comet. How much hold gravity has on you determines which of these will be your course.

Having thought about this, I suddenly realized its analogy for my life. 

Let's say that birth was my takeoff. Successful launch, but I expend tremendous amounts of energy building an understanding of my orbital system. This first familiar environment is often the first "home" system, and in reality few really experience settling into more than one or two systems in life.

I went away my final two years of high school, propelling to another system. Moving from one system to another became my style, one at which I became fairly efficient. To do that, though, you have to travel light and time your arrivals/departures well. You've only the energy of one life, after all. You become very strict about what you hold on to and how long you hang around. In retrospect, i can see my circle of friends cycling entirely every three to five years, supporting this theory.

Alternatively, you find a group heading in the same direction and distribute the expense of propulsion to the next destination. In my case, perhaps the friends made while living in Asia or even just Fru and I both wanting to give California a try.

At some point, though, you may find yourself a long way from home with few others headed in your direction (whether that direction is home, a past destination or somewhere new). You're in orbit of a gravity source that may not be very interesting to you, and you don't want to waste precious fuel without a definite target. Maybe the group you're with wants to stay around a little longer than you do, or they've decided they no longer want to travel further. Or maybe you went on solo and now are in search of the next target.

Here's where the perpetual question arises again: should one stop planet hopping and become a satellite? Is this the best there is? Better than moving, better than going back? And each time the question is asked, I imagine the lure of settling down becoming more inviting. Settling into an orbit allows you to add on more weighted comforts; you'll only be adjusting position--not charting a course. The orbit provides things like days and nights--things you can build life around.

I think that's where I am right now. I think my wife is wanting to find a system where we can establish a low-power orbit. Increasingly, more friends are orbiting systems of their own with a scant few traveling their own course far, far away. The idea of permanent orbit, to me, sounds foreign; jetting back to another system to orbit with friends seems just as permanent, risky and wasteful; and catching up with far flung travelers seems downright illogical. So the natural thing for me to do is to look for a new planet to target.

Despite my come-what-may philosophies, I'm realizing that perhaps I should find a specific path to pursue--not for my job, but for  life. Failing to plan does mean planning to fail, yet I'm finding something slightly more insidious: one can easily start to think of their job *as their life*.

Think about it. If you're in your thirties, like me, you may define yourself by your career more than you realize. But, if you're like me, you definitely can remember a time that work was the thing you did *to pay for the things you actually wanted to do*. You weren't a pizza technician or a cashier; you were a guitarist or a skater,  a party animal, a car enthusiast, an outdoorsman.

Maybe it's because we filled the "I want to be when I grow up" variable with a value of professional kind. Slowly you start to think of yourself as your profession. Worse, those people who cling to their passions instead of their title increasingly are thought of in irresponsible hues--the wanna-be actress, the deadbeat dude. 

I wonder who's the biggest deadbeat: the person who can't predict their future because they live in the moment or the person who has sacrificed their soul passion to make work the central piece of their existence? If "deadbeat" has anything to do with "heartbeat," the answer may be painfully clear. 

I'm thankful that I now realize that I don't want to be a TPM. I need to find out what it is I want to spend the rest of the hours of my day doing, because being a TPM is a great occupation which I enjoy that can readily support those pursuits.

Tonight I'm thinking about erosion. 

I'm in Chicago right now. I'm not sure if I can think of any immediate examples of geographical erosion in Illinois. In California, they are abundant, even right where we live among the Diablo foothills. 

![image of hills by Randal Beetle | flickr](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1432/4724408238_80bd53b5a3_z.jpg)
Photo [source](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rb_photos/4724408238)

Whether by water, by wind or by [hand](http://vigeland.museum.no/en/information/news-events/452-the-angry-boys-golden-hand) you can find nature taking a shape--a shape that in response to interaction; a shape that yields the least resistance. Like the pebbles in a creek, all things that are not broken are worn down. 

We often think of erosion regretfully. We would that things could avoid the wearing down that [time inevitably brings](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/02/churchill-thatcher-statues-mps-touching). We look at ourselves in the mirror, a weary husk of the youth and vigor we once exuded. But when I look at those hills I can see peace and serenity; an end to struggle and a sense of *flow*.

#go with the flow

Flow itself has varying connotations. To "go with the flow" may mean to cooperate or be amenable, yet it may also mean to invest little in what you feel is right. For me, what is right is often associated with spiritual matters; lacking resolve to live by convictions is a kind of flow I simply can't condone. 

Yet as I grow older I seem to notice the erosion of things that predate me. I've seen people grow old, weak, lifeless. I've seen families grow distant. I've seen certain societal evolutions that seem an awful lot like erosion to me, though saying so makes me feel like the old people in my youth. I've seen people do things I never imagined they would all because, seemingly, they've just accepted the flow and gone with it. 

It makes me wonder what I will erode into. Mountains can erode into hills, rivers into canyons. Many many other things erode into something less than history--forgotten completely, with the faintest essence of having existed it's best hope. What will I flow with, and how will it shape me? What features will gain prominence as my time wears on?

I don't think I ever imagined what life would be like at thirty-seven. My teens were looking forward, but not this far; my twenties were about the moment. My thirties have been a slow bending of my will until I, hunched and warped, sit in a permanent position of looking back at the life I let slip away. Already I find it so hard to imagine looking forward to anything to come. 

My inclinations have support:

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But seriously, I do find myself in a bit of an odd place, having moved in my early thirties to a place where I had no existing relationships and my industry is in a love affair with the young and daring. I've had serious conversations with others in my age group about the number of startups we'll be able to work in after the ones we're in--not because we're tired, but because ageism would complicate our ability to be hired, to connect with our teams. 

I also don't have a ton of resources to identify what I'm supposed to do _next_. How does a 37-year old dress? Where does he shop? Does he still listen to top 40? What are his pastimes? Besides his children, seeing as I've not pursued that option. Where is the guild of middle-aged adventurers? I mean, the guild that isn't also the creepy old guy association. 

I guess I'll have to figure it out on my own. Guess that's as good a reason to fire up the old blog as any.

This weekend was a bit of a whirlwind adventure. We took a red-eye flight Friday evening to Dulles International Airport, just outside of the DC area, and then hopped in a rental to drive two or three hours to Wintergreen, Virginia, where my good friend Mark took the hand of his lovely lady Michelle in marriage. The ceremony was Sunday afternoon; shortly thereafter the trek was reversed: leave Wintergreen at three in the morning, make our way back to IAD for a 7am flight back to San Francisco just over 48 hours after we landed. 

Because of the tight turnaround (which admittedly was due to poor planning on my part) I didn't expect much by way of substance; I assumed all events to be part of a single blur. To be sure, I didn't get the same appreciation for the event as those who spent the full four nights in celebration. Yet, even in that tiny window, something happened. 

I got to speak again to Mark's parents: his mother, so gentle, and his father, always pleasant. I finally met his older sister, bright and energetic, and loads of super-friendly uncles, aunts and cousins. Truly, Mark is an amalgam of his tribe. 

I met Michelle's family, which I'd never had the good fortune despite knowing her for years. Her mother is _a mother_--one of those women whom the world revolves around; whose power and influence is only matched by the warm and caring twinkle in their eyes. That twinkle is matched in the eyes of her husband, Michelle's father, and his kind, affable spirit that quietly charms. Where Mark seems the stew of his family's ingredients, Michelle (and her older sister) seem to be shaped by the mold of their loving family, fitting their spaces perfectly and completing the portrait of love.

I ran into a bunch of old friends. Though our time with them only overlapped slightly, Michelle and I ran with the many of the same people back in the '00s, so it was a bit of a reunion seeing friendly faces that I've not seen with frequency for nearly a decade. When I moved to the Maryland area, these people and others were my influencers as I trimmed off the rural Delaware fuzz and became a smooth metropolitan dweller. I didn't expect to encounter my formative years, but there they were, providing a contrast to my current existence. 

Of course, there were many people I didn't know: people who were special to Mark and Michelle in one way or another, who shared stories of adventures in far off lands or even lived in those lands with Mark and Michelle as their work relocated them to various destinations on the globe. A humorous quirk about this couple is the number of places they've both lived--and how none of those places they lived at the same time. Friends from a half dozen countries and at least four continents showed up on a mountainside in rural Virginia to celebrate the couple and connect the dots of their lives' journey. 

The wedding was delayed by rain but wonderful atmospheric setting rewarded the wedding party's perseverance. As the sun set behind patches of clouds, everyone ate on the resort's stone terrace and listened to family speeches about how lovely the couple were and how hopeful we all were for their future. It was in those speeches that my heart began to gasp--as if it has been submerged for a very long time, and only now had it found itself able to breathe at the surface. Michelle's father, through his words and stature during his speech, suddenly became (for me) Phil Follett; a hero/mentor from my past who I wish so dearly that I could see again and ask what I should do with my life. The speech of Michelle's sister called attention to all the work that Mark and Michelle put into the wedding--not to make it a spectacle but to bring us all together and make it special for us as much as (if not more than) for them. Michelle's own speech spoke to the nature of their own hearts and the decision both have made in committing their lives to serving others through their jobs with humanitarian relief agencies. My heart was breathing again, and I held back tears.

__I don't hate California. I don't even dislike San Francisco. I dreadfully miss being around people who care for others.__

People who welcome strangers into their homes. People who respond to disasters with action. People who look to strengthen others and find that one thing that makes them special. People who carry the burden of their friends, family, colleagues or even casual associates as if they were their own. People who seek to be accessible rather than exceptional; who consider it a joy to be a servant rather than a leader. 

For many years I was inexplicably fortunate to be in a circle of individuals who truly cared for the world and its residents, and it was only in this two-day jaunt that I realized how little of the world I've experienced since then carries this same spirit. The question now is whether that absence--which I now know I cannot live happily without--is a rarity. Is it found only in pockets of special people sprinkled globally? Or just absent where I am in the bay area, with its chasing of unicorn companies and IPOs and rampant homelessness, unreasonable cost of living and filthy streets?

I've been gone from Twitter now for over a year; I left last July, joining LendUp in August. If you had asked me this time last year about the change I'd have been pure saccharine: I'd found a company whose mission I believe in, realized that the free food and celebrity visits weren't half as important as I'd thought and given myself a challenge and opportunity to grow. If you asked me six months ago, my tune would have changed a bit: It felt I might be testing the limits of my abilities--which was what I'd signed up for. Even though I might occasionally think about the delicious meals and comforts Twitter afforded, I was excited to be giving my all for a company who wanted to improve the lives of others.  

Then August came. LinkedIn reminded everyone that I was having a a work anniversary, and my inbox was flooded with a bunch of nearly-identical well wishes, interspersed with an occasional real inquiry. More than one of those unscripted ones mentioned surprise that I was still in San Francisco, which I chalked up to us just not being in touch as often as we'd once been. 

I also went to Mark's wedding in August, which I last wrote about. An old acquaintance asked me bluntly: "Why are you still in San Francisco?" He'd visited with his family a year or two ago and we'd discussed the pros and cons of living in the city by the bay. My response consisted mainly my [personal desire](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2015/03/something-big.htm) the mission of LendUp to succeed and finding a place I liked better where I would be able to earn similar income. Not my most inspiring answer, but it was true. As you may have read in the post, I found myself cheerleading rapidly losing steam.

A few days after returning, I'm chatting with a cousin in NY, talking about dreams of giving disadvantaged communities tech training or teaching low-income parents what their computer-inclined kids need to be successful. As someone who's historically been involved with kids he supports the concept and tries to convince me to "come to the nonprofit side" as if I'd not worked in that space before him. 

"Lol I did know that which is why I was surprised you entered the heart of the storm," he texted. "From the outside, San Fran [sic] seems very anti-Leftsider."

Hmm... three independent inputs in the course of a month questioning my fealty to the bay area. It's true that my feelings about the area never reached my initial expectations, but as I've [moved around](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2014/11/finding-the-promised-land.htm) I've found little things that have made me hope that all is not lost in the area; that prosperity and diversity and altruism can find homeostasis here. But maybe I'm fooling myself; now over five years into this California experiment, how long is necessary to come to a [conclusion](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2011/08/zombies-vs-androids.html)?

Lately I've been thinking about what I should do next. Not that I'm checked out of what I'm doing now, but, well, [everyone else seems to think I'm in the wrong spot](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2016/09/ive-been-gone-from-twitter.htm). So I ask myself: If I wasn't doing this, [what would I be doing](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2016/02/dont-be-your-job-dude.htm)? 

Far be it from me to pretend I'd be successful wherever I chose to cast my gaze. I live with "the Delaware Disease": having grown up watching people spurn Delaware only to sheepishly return and take one's waiting space in anonymous sub-mediocrity, I have this "when not if" mentality that assumes all this awesome will fall miserably at some point. It's happily ever after for the select few; for the rest of us it's "happily followed by ever after."

So while I fight the paralysis such a perspective might bring, I'm never throwing caution to the wind. The next move I make has to be sound and strategic; it should extend the run I'm on rather than place it under extreme risk. Additionally, it should have at least as much impact on the good of others as I'm hoping to provide through the support of LendUp. And it wouldn't hurt if it kept me in the same pay bracket. 

As I've been thinking about this kind of stuff, I've discovered some really interesting resources. First, there's a whole site on [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/_ really made me think about the key qualifications for my next opportunity. And that was somewhat supported by what I read from the [80,000 hours resource site](https://80000hours.org/). The sobering realization of how good I have it was really driven home by the short quiz on the [Giving what We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i/) website, and while it wasn't a part of their [list of top charities](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/top-charities/) [GiveDirectly.org](https://www.givedirectly.org/) has a fantastic program that I'm eager to support. 

Which all makes me think that rather then trying to go out at change the world (like I and others did in their youth), perhaps now is the time to be a patron of causes, the person whose monetary contribution far outstretches what their active participation could provide. As long as I could find a comfortable, tolerable, well-paying job that had little risk of going away, I could have direct impact on hundreds--even thousands--of lives connected to causes I feel strongly about. And let's be honest, more then a little part of me loves the idea of playing tech Robin Hood, redistributing the wealth of the Silicon Valley to raise the standard of living for those in extreme poverty. 

If I'm lucky, perhaps my next moves will be the best yet.

BODY:
When my CEO asked me to be involved in finding others who do what I do, it was a proud moment. I remembered my first week on the job and this same person saying essentially, "I'm not sure what you do, but they say we need you... looking forward to your work!" Now, eighteen months later, I had earned my employment it seemed. 

When he suggested that I not just be involved but consider leading, managing a team of peers, instead of showing excitement and eagerness to grow I responded vaguely, becoming demure at subsequent mentions. I told myself it was my long-running avoidance of being someone's boss, but as I considered it more, it was easy to see that was not true. 

Why was I resisting growth and opportunity? How did I become this hesitant and uncertain about my abilities? A bit of soul searching was in order. I came to recognize a self-imposed restriction on being my best; I've been actively avoiding being great. Allow me to step off of my "win and lose as a team" soapbox and point a few fingers at [my first few months in California](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2011/08/zombies-vs-androids.html).

When I moved west, I left my position as an assistant communications director for the Seventh-Day Adventist Church for a 6-month contract-to-hire role as a support agent at Twitter. I'd never done customer support; the role was pitched as more user advocacy than customer service, so I figured my past [peddling user experience](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2010/11/confessions-of-the-ux-ex.htm) would serve well. It did not. When I asked my team leads what [personas](http://uxmas.com/2013/the-power-of-personas) were used in determining our responses to users, "what's a persona?" was the only reply. Instead of pushing the envelope and encouraging a new approach I let it drop and focused on my conversion. 

You see, I'd already bumped into invisible boundaries. My manager and his manager called me into a room, concerned about a tweet-based discussion I was having with my mutual friends on their opinion of Twitter. They felt my tweets were "telling the user they were wrong," not disagreeing with the opinion of my friends and debating points civilly. Having just abandoned a position where my words and actions were necessarily scrutinized, I was a bit heartbroken to see the same happening here for much less logical a reason. I changed how I used my Twitter account, created private accounts, and followed the party line.

I'd already been in the habit of biting my lip. During my interview process I felt I hit it off with one of my interviewees, but when I showed up for work, I perceived a cold shoulder. There was nothing I could do that would elicit more than a two word answer out of this person's mouth, and it unnerved me. They were also a fairly central figure on my team, so that perceived polarized interaction often translated into awkwardness socializing with other peers. In true East Coast fashion I intended to tell him about himself, but in discussing my frustrations with my sister she reminded me, "you're not there to win friends; you're there to convert to a full time position. I put my head down and focused on my key objective. 

It was no surprise to me, then, that when I was asked by several Adventist-run media outlets to share my experience in the tech world I got the thumbs down from Twitter's communication team. This previously unknown dude from the support team came asking permission to be interviewed by magazines and send media clips to TV stations overseas--it didn't make any sense. "I'm sure you spend a lot of time on this," they said (I'd done a single take in the minutes before coming into the office), "but we have a select list of people who speak on behalf of the company." I waved it off and gave up trying to be who I was and just focused on being who was needed for my job. 

Twitter wasn't [all bad](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2015/07/leaving-twitter.htm); it was by no means a prison sentence, and in fact my job became a bit of a haven from the stresses I'd been feeling [in my personal life](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2014/06/bondage-and-freedom.htm). On top of those burdens, when I reached out to people who I considered family--as well as professional counselors--for advice on communicating with someone we both loved dearly, what I received in return was very hurtful opinions about me, my ability, and my relationship with my spouse. 

So my abilities, my voice, my sense of belonging, my financial freedom--all these things stripped from me in perhaps my first 90 days in California? Twenty-seven hundred miles away from anyone who I was certain valued me for who I am? I am at fault for choosing acceptance over authenticity, but the circumstances certainly didn't help. 

So here we are now. All of that? Past. But somehow that past was still holding my future captive.

So the question is: how does one undo this binding and return to being me? How do I relearn what I'm capable of, self acceptance and self belief? How do I reengage and by doing so give even more reason others can believe what I'm selling? And how long does that process take? Opportunities don't last forever.

BODY:
When my colleague dropped a note in the #random slack channel polling for readers of James Baldwin's "[Fire Next Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fire_Next_Time)," I responded. In truth, I'd not yet read it, but I had been struck by his stirring perspectives when [I encountered the documentary](https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/187041) he hosted about San Francisco when [I wrote a bit](https://medium.com/@leftsider/strange-fruit-e03d9b7481e) about the complexities of being a professional black male in the area. I had made a note to read more from him, and this implied lie to my coworker prompted me to make a weekend's work of it. 

I started it [as I travelled to Canada](https://www.instagram.com/p/BUit6wFAXEe/), and by the time I got back I'd finished it--and gained an entirely new view of myself and the world. Baldwin puts forth a few groundbreaking assertions. 

First a foremost, a black person must not come to believe that which society believes about him/her. The range in which the black person operates is prescribed narrow, and there is no expectation for a black person to step beyond that range except in prescribed ways. These ways, of course, are white ways: the practices and principles which permit acceptance into a culture that is defined by and designed for white people and the preservation of their power.

Second, the culture of white people is abhorrent. It is based upon white superiority and non-white inferiority. It "burdens" the white man with correcting the savage ways of others, often in cruel and immoral ways. There is no white triumph that is not violent, no pinnacle or glorious era that isn't marked by brutish, greedy amassing of power. It has always been about power and the ability to control, to enforce, to compel--and the fear of losing that power.

Third, no sane non-white person should ever desire to be accepted by white people into their culture except that they be brainwashed into accepting that which society believes about them. There is no place of honor for the non-white in that world, nor is that worldview appropriate for this world of whites and non-whites. It is not reflective of reality; white is not superior (or inferior) to non-white. It seems silly to even assert that it is, but notice the visceral reactions to phrases like "black lives matter" or "black is beautiful." 

Fourth, it is not for us, non-whites, to be accepted by white people, but for white people to be accepted by us. There is a perception of immediate threat to white power and control when non-white perspectives take equal footing, as just noted. This is immature, to be kind. In such immaturity, fears are revealed which illuminate who the white person really is. Fear of other equal cultures creates the nigger, the chink and the spic. Fear of powerful retributive justice creates the thug, the gangbanger. Fear of a brown, non-Christian worldview creates the war on terror, and so on. These are names and concepts direct from their worldview, which we are wise (as previously noted) to not accept. We must instead reject these views for the troubling misperceptions that they are and insist upon a more realistic and accepting worldview for our America.

Fifth, black Americans are true Americans. We were born here: brought over as property and disconnected from our heritage, treated as subhuman for centuries and then marginalized for generations. We may not be the true Native American, but we are most certainly America's original cultural product. This country belongs to us in a way that, when realized, is amazing. It is our responsibility, then to make America not "great again" (ugh) but what it should be--and to help all Americans become their best self. 

Finally, pity them to avoid being consumed by their anger and hatred. [The goal is not to identify and take down enemies; it is to enlighten minds and use that expanded awareness to improve life for all](https://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/877566469600550912) Americans--even all humanity. There are white people who understand this and are consciously developing themselves, which is arduous and is commendable. White people are not our adversaries, though sometimes it seems an opponent is all some ever look for. Ignorance and illusion is our enemy. It is our burden to show our best example--our most beautiful self--and extend the logic of love, the true tool of[ the oppressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy_of_the_Oppressed). 

Stacked next to my [recent reflections](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2017/06/returning-to-me.htm), this is paradigm changing for me. It springs new life into who I am and [where I want to be](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2016/10/job-perks.htm).

If you are deliberate in your doing, you can learn something new each day. Imagine the wealth of knowledge you could potentially obtain. Your last day on this earth will be your clearest picture of what it means to exist, to be alive; let us hope that you and I both will have many days to get a better sense of the picture life presents us. 

I think that even now I'm starting to recognize the edges of [the circle of life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW7PlTaawfQ). Yesterday I walked across a bit of UC Berkeley campus and marveled at how young the student population looked. It was all very fascinating until I realized that if I had a kid at age 20 I could very well be visiting my freshman son or daughter on this campus--which meant that the young population I was gawking at had reason to assume I was a parent on campus. Sobering. 

My friend was retracing the steps he took seventeen years ago, back when he spent a year studying Chinese at the university. Back then, he'd only been in the states for a year or so, studying abroad while his family was back home in Japan. He did the math and discovered that he's now around the age his father was when he was born, and that was a bit unnerving. 

Unnerving because he wondered if he was that far off the mark--or was it that his father, who seemed so sure and certain, was once as uncertain and ambivalent as he is now. I, myself often wonder about this. When younger colleagues look to me for career advice, I wonder if those to whom I asked guidance felt as inept. When my crazy college buddy turns into an elementary school educator, I wonder if those teachers I admired were just as questionable as he and his peers appear to be to me, now, as an adult. 

I see strangers die, then friends grandparents die. Now, friends parents--and even a few friends. I think about my deceased grandfather who lived into his nineties; perhaps on his last day he knew more dead loved ones than living ones. I see my parents retire and realize that they're now older than my grandparents were when I was born. 

Each day another layer of the onion is removed. The things that are truly unfathomable about this beautiful world grow imperceptibly smaller with each layer pulled away. Over time, you can see the shape of things that you couldn't before. That your heroes are human. That your flaws are common. That your hopes are childishly selfish. That your fears are largely self-made. 

> [For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13%3A12&version=KJV)

Perhaps, if we are lucky enough, we'll have many more days to learn and realize, to open our eyes and truly see.

Fru and I have recently adopted the word "best" as a noun. It's a thing that requires unpacking.

Neither of us would consider our current selves our "best selves." Perhaps we've gotten a bit comfortable, or a bit soft; perhaps we've aged or just relied on momentum rather than maintaining intent. At any rate, we know that there's room for progress. 

Recognizing room for growth and establishing a path for our improvement is an internal task, yet very little of the word "best" is inward-facing. Being the best on the team, the best of class, the best in the world--all of this channels inner growth outward and into external domination. While few speak of this, many sense it--which is why it is common to counteract the aggressive nature of "the best" with an inward-facing counterbalance: asking (or at least suggesting) that one should do *their* best.

What is your best and what is my best are two different things. And, unfortunately, one may use that idiosyncrasy to permit or even defend current behavior. Who of us has not responded with, "I'm doing my best!" when, in truth, we knew that our best wasn't actually the space we were working from and that the space we were working from wouldn't yield an optimal result?

So these are our two conundrums: doing "one's best" may result in *not* doing one's best, and that doing one's best--even when actually achieved--may not have an external reward. 

When thinking of the latter I can't help but think of [Evgenia Medvedeva](https://slate.com/culture/2018/02/evgenia-medvedeva-is-the-worlds-best-skater-and-she-loves-dancing-in-malls.html). I am not knowledgeable in ice skating, but after watching [her performance at the 2018 Winter Olympics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mxCtzyHL6k) I felt [along with others](https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/zagitova-medvedeva-olympic-figure-skating-upset.html) that she gave her very best in that moment, reaching such an expressive athletic level that she surely should have earned more reward than [that which was received](https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/2/23/17043540/evgenia-medvedeva-alina-zagitova-olympics-figure-skating).

Still, we must pursue best, and I think athletes--and not just the best ones like Medvedeva--best exemplify this. To be good at a sport is one thing; to truly master a sport is another. Achieving mastery requires bringing your best consistently--consistently enough that you can surpass it. It requires a lot of failure and even more study, training, practice. At some point that indefatigable tenacity and pursuit of the mastery permeates [other areas of their life](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/22358028/the-nba-obsession-wine). Being surrounded by the best becomes a support structure for maintaining that best. 

It is this resource-intensive, metastasis-like quality which leaves many of us afraid to strive for the best. Can I strive for best in one area of my life and accept mediocrity in others? Do I have enough confidence in self to persist through failure and loss? Can I do this without seeming [petulant](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/02/22/a-canadian-hockey-player-refuses-to-wear-silver-medal-after-loss-to-u-s/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.1998f5293a06) or [entitled](https://apnews.com/518e53f5dcec4c86bd62a0e3e170d151) or [obnoxious](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/18/elon-musk-apologises-for-calling-thai-cave-rescue-diver-a-pedo)? Am I even pursuing the right thing, or am I wasting time and energy in a delusion? It's easier to accept the role we're given than to face the criticism of crafting your reality.

For me, this thought process stemmed from watching Cristiano Ronaldo play in the 2018 FIFA World Cup. I like Ronaldo (largely because I am drawn to people whose success causes [consternation](http://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/2247212/cristiano-ronaldo-33-reasons-to-love-or-hate-him) in others) and I felt he performed really well in the tournament, [adding records](http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/ronaldo-finally-has-a-world-cup-performance-to-sit-alongside-his-/qvhs25c6727q1qzz72mib4b4t) to an already illustrious career. Perhaps it was the position he plays for his national team versus the one he played for Real Madrid, but the 32-year old's efforts seemed more mature and internally focused than in the past. More team focused, less animated, but with an unmistakable intensity that seemed ready to bend the world to his will. My (admitted) inferences made me wonder whether, after all these years of silencing critics and surpassing expectations, Ronaldo had nothing left but to ask himself, "is there any area of my life that is not the best it can be?"

Is there any part of my life that isn't short of best?

So we're speaking best, conjuring through conversation a better understanding between where we are and what best could mean. We're allowing ourselves to want, to care, to act. And if we're fortunate, we'll be able to look at something--even one thing--in our lives and know that it could be no better.

A few thoughts after this weekend's viewing of the movie "Crazy Rich Asians":

 - The movie is, on its surface, a very uncomplicated romantic comedy set in a beautiful and lavish environment. From this perspective, the story plays by the numbers while jolting the viewer with a few unique elements that keep them plugged in. This is a brilliant play, as this is what allows the rest of the world--those who are not in some way familiar with (an) Asian culture--to plug into what is, at its core, a movie by Asians for Asians. Draped around that basic and uncomplicated framework is a rich array of Asian concepts, practices and cultural patterns so intricate and layered that it nearly matches the lavish outlay of money and designer branding that is a basis of the movie (an, in many cases, Asian culture). If representing culture could be done in a way that mimics the *nouveau riche*, this would be it. 
 - Did I say a movie for Asians by Asians? I should be more accurate. This is a movie *by Chinese for Chinese*. Here is the danger of heralding Crazy Rich Asians as a step forward in diversity: [it isn't](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/world/asia/crazy-rich-asians-cast-singapore.html). It's a ham-fisted concession that reinforces to anyone not Asian (or not paying attention) that Asian = Chinese. Singapore, where the movie is placed, has [government-mandated accommodation](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/singapore/568567/) that wrestle with the complexities of the country's diversity. It's national anthem is in Malay. Chinese students learn Tamil in school. But in this movie the only faces that aren't the C in Singapore's CMIO are security guards, boat captains, and servicepersons. I only recall hearing one "lah" in the whole movie, which [isn't Singapore at all](https://www.citylab.com/life/2018/08/the-selective-singapore-of-crazy-rich-asians/568399/). The romantic comedy may not have set out to tackle these harder issues, but that doesn't give us permission to champion a movie that didn't really do much except be in Asia.
 - The irony of a party-line rom-com that reinforces the mean of Asian perception (crazy, rich, chinese) taking a stab at advocating for the abandonment of "traditions for tradition's sake" is not lost on me. Be the [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American-born_Chinese) that topples the matriarchal barrier to your dreams! But do so in a way that allows everyone to save face! I felt similarly about the storyline of [Coco](http://remezcla.com/lists/film/latino-film-critics-review-pixar-coco/), which I adore, but I think Crazy Rich Asians did a better job of reflecting everyone involved taking a progressive step forward. In Coco, nothing really changes beyond Miguelito getting family-approved cause to play guitar for a living. 
 - Walking out of the theater, Fru and I discussed how well this movie was able to display (without much pointing out) the circles of asian culture. They differ from culture to culture and demographic to demographic, so in this Sino-Singaporean environment, those selected for presentation are:
    - the money-burdened: those of old money who ostensibly honor where their money came from and thus must be austere
    - the moneyed: those not of old money yet who are also very loaded. They strive to be associated with the money-burdened yet have less obligation to strictness and more desire to celebrate wealth
    - the shallows: an undefined mass of people going beyond their means to look like/be with wealth. They want to appear rich and experience a "rich" lifestyle, to the chagrin of the moneyed--whose attempts to infiltrate the old money circles can be burdened by flashiness of these hangers-on
 - Thus a hybrid game of "tag" and "keep away" emerges, with groups chasing and avoiding each other to complicated effect. Friendships and associations can almost never be taken at face value, and thus having the protagonist operate as an expert in game theory was a **perfect** setup to analyze these patterns. To be honest, the movie didn't analyze this at all--standard rom-coms have a way of not being too analytical--but I hope the book delved into this a bit more.
 - Selecting these circles rather than others was a smart move, as there's something similar almost everywhere you go around the world. There's some manifestation of class, standing and pretense to which all viewers can associate to their own culture except, perhaps, black Americans. We just have "athletes/entertainers" and "the rest of us." The closest to Crazy Rich Asians is Willow and Jaden Smith, which is a relatively new phenomenon (hurry and grow up, Blue Ivy!) This makes me weirdly wistful, hoping for a day where success for black Americans is broad enough that our community matures to the level where we can be classist to each other and flaunt a vapid-yet-austere post-money lifestyle that embraces, rather than rejects, our difficult heritage. I'm certain there are better things to wish for, but it would be nice for it to not be someone else's story for a change.

All said, a fun weekend watch.

BODY:
In mid-october, I was let go by my employer. The company, unable to come to a timely solution to its funding round, split into two and laid off about 50 people. For many it was a shock; fortunately I had slightly more visibility and actually brought a bigger bag to work on the day so I could easily collect my things. 

There are three main areas where people go when they discover what happened:

1. Are you ok?
2. What's next? 
3. Are you going to stay in the bay?

I'll answer them in order. 

First, this is difficult to answer. Because no, I'm not ok...but the reason isn't because of the layoff. The gut punch happened about a month earlier, after several conversations with Mozilla Corporation for a role as a program manager for their Firefox product. I'd seen the role, and reached out to a friend who'd worked there previously. He gave a great recommendation to a former colleague who turned out to be the hiring manager. We talked via phone and it seemed a sure thing. Only it wasn't, and the rejection email really laid me low. I reached out to two other companies and my interest fell on deaf ears. I was completely spooked. I took time to do a personal retrospective and realized some interesting things. 

I realized I hadn't been rejected for a role I pursued in well over a decade, and that was because it had been well over a decade since I'd not had someone on the inside wanting to bring me in. This made me worry a bit less that I was somehow flawed and unfit, but it also made me worry a bit more that I hadn't been rejected _more_ in that time span. Had I not challenged myself and now had to learn about life away from easy street? Were my skills sharp and my presentation solid when I never had need to show them? It angered me a little that I'd just allowed myself to be taken by the current of my company rather than navigating my own path with intent. 

So by the time the layoff came I was already done with the notion of my job being where I was going to grow. And the time not working and interviewing, and connecting with others has helped me trim the fat from my work and really polish my pitch. 

Second, I don't know. If I'd gotten a more reasonable severance for my service...probably some time wandering Asia. As that didn't happen--and as Fru is now full time in a programming school--it forced me to pretty much start the job search immediately, which isn't that great given the holiday season is upon us. I've got enough savings to cover a couple month's expenses, so I'm not freaking out and trying to be selective without being picky. But as I told someone recently, I don't actually have a job "type" I'm looking for: generally an opportunity will introduce itself and then, considering the possibilities of me in that role, I either get excited and pursue or let it pass. My work history is pretty varied as a result, so I don't expect that to change now. 

One thing that is "next," though, is the number of opportunities that are now about leading rather than being an individual contributor. And this is something that goes back to the first point; it is time to stop simply working the magic. It is time to showcase the magic, explain the magic, teach the magic and develop a culture of magic that expands far beyond my reach. So while I've eschewed management and leadership in the past, I'm open to it now.

Finally, yes for now. My sister and her family moved to the area this summer, so I'd like to stick around for them. I'm also directing my job search away from SF for as long as possible--seven years working in a 10-block radius doesn't give me confidence that my view of the tech industry is comprehensive. If I'm successful, I'll find myself back with a company that accommodates a bit more for my wanderlust--which may allow me to actually maintain a base while still feeding my travel cravings. 

It will be good to be back on the job; I tend to get a bit stir crazy without a lot of work to do, and a project manager left to their own devices will just end up creating projects that don't exist or nosing into the projects of others. The California fires and their affect on the air quality has also had a suppressing effect on my mental state, but we're free of that now. I'll enjoy the freedom a bit more and work to further improve self for the next adventure.

*[The following is a series of texts sent I sent to a friend a few days ago. Yes, I sent all of this via text to someone. Minor edits were made to match the new medium.]*


> So I think I told you that every year I come up with a new theme... last year's was to be a star 

> Well, [it started specifically around the sun](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdbZh1IAeRo/) but the fascination expanded 

> That's how we got on the whole "[build a universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3zT-piA1jY)" kick that I hope you're still building 

> But as the year ended I was a little down for various understandable [reasons](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2018/11/leftsider-unemployed.htm)... and then I kinda focused in on the fact that nothing was going to change if I kept doing the same thing...and why was I don't the same thing again? 

> So 2019's motto became "break it and remake it" 

> Actually it started out "[break it 'til you make it](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsGjZDiFZYf/)" but the new version is a bit more marketable, and put my fate in my own hands (and not luck's) 

> So I actually had something else to share with you that is only slightly related, but that gives a backdrop so let's just call that END SCENE ONE 

> SCENE TWO

> I came home today and was kinda mopey... not because anything's wrong but just because I'm here [in the new crib](https://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/1103375649085915141) all alone (Fru comes on the 17th) and not really feeling energetic enough to go brave the nightlife, which is amplified due to [SXSW](https://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/1104932754930704384)

> So I curled up on my loveseat and opened instagram and saw [this super cute post](https://www.instagram.com/p/But_EenI-rM/) by my brilliantly creative friend Ian and his kids  

> And then I saw another one of my friends, [James Buckhouse](https://jamesbuckhouse.com/), had commented on it and I didn't actually follow Buckhouse so I went to his account and saw that [his Sensorium event](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuZZXixHTef/) happened at the SF Opera the night I arrived in ATX 

> And then I got really mopey because I've attended all his prior events both as a supporter and to be creatively stimulated.

> See his design story of the idea [here](https://medium.com/design-story/total-design-f4d9f5537341) (scroll to the bottom to see [me and Fru with him](https://twitter.com/Leftsider/status/575665500660756480) at the first event)

> But then as I kept scrolling through his instagram my mopey-ness melted and my awe began to rise: He's *doing* this. This isn't his day job; this is his joy. [He's *making it*](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkyiKSVlYZ2/)

> Now I'm inspired. END SCENE TWO 

> --FINAL SCENE--   

> I hop up from the couch, and move to the dining table to *make something.* not sure what, but it doesn't matter. If it's wrong, I'll break it and remake it. If it's good, I still might break and remake it just on principle. The making is the important part. 

> I need some music to go with this energy. Something creative. Something classical. I can't think of any modern composers so I open spotify with the intent to find an artist similar to Daniel Hope... but for some reason I remember him as Daniel Glass and search this name instead 

> Daniel Glass has no albums of his own and only appears on two other releases. That's because he's an unknown jazz drummer, not a world-renowned violinist 

> (Fun fact: at this time, spotify says you were listening to "Rock the Casbah") 

> One of the albums he appears on is called "[Imagine Your Heart's Journeys](https://open.spotify.com/album/4N4zfWiWRwdks2mYZcjTKl?si=KFTZlxuMTrmmyL6vTl01Bg)." It looks questionable. I hit play. 

> It jumps to life, and I roll with it. By the third song, I think I may have found this year's Space Kelly 😂  *[NOTE: there's an earlier text tome where I share the story of finding [this album](https://open.spotify.com/album/1NtdMK7WDHJZdJQi8PnelX?si=3WnYG7DtQK2NRvt9kIsRqQ) on Rdio (RIP) and how it, embarrassingly, never fails to improve my mood]*

> But by the end, I'm certain that this was the album I was to listen to. It's got like 26 monthly listeners, but it oozes with love for the music. It's someone else *[MAKING IT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGzd5VR2z-U)* 

> What if we could shake off pretense and do what we love? Build what we've imagined?

BODY:
After about six months of peppering our sex therapist with questions regarding the logic behind her method, she suggested that I volunteer for an upcoming Somatica practitioner training. As a volunteer, I could see the method being taught and come to understand the bigger picture. 

The volunteer list was already full, but seed was planted; after attending an open house I talked with Fru and decided to sign up for the four-session, twenty-day Somatica training course. Despite being laid off a month later, I committed to the expense. I've completed one five-day session so far, and it's already been life changing. 

I didn't grow up in an environment that was open to analyzing internal feelings and emotions; perhaps folks only associated therapy with being psycho/already crazy. So therapy--and openly referencing therapy--was a big move for me on its own. Still, certain things I scoffed at and refused to consider. Through Somatica, however, I've come to accept the notion of an "inner child." It's not some imaginary friend or abstract concept; it's the shape on which you were formed.

Think of a tree, cross-cut. When you look at the cut, you'll see rings. The rings of the tree help us to see the age of a tree and the environmental conditions. Looking at the inner rings, you can imagine what the tree experienced at an earlier time. The inner child is you at an earlier time. You can look back, see something that happened, and trace the effects back to your current situation. 

As a child, growing up in a rural area with no children besides my younger sister, I associated with friends and cousins only at school or church. In my mind, they all had their own neighborhood friends and shared experiences, of which I was not a part. The people I considered friend always had other friends--and often friends with whom they were closer than they were with me. From a very early age I had a notion of being included rather than belonging. I had a transactional view of relationships: I was welcome if I understood the rules, played the way others played. So I paid to play. That was how my little kid brain thought was the best way to survive, so that's what it did. 

Decades later, I've been around the world, changing locations and friends every three to five years. I operate in patterns and frameworks. I'm very good at integrating and have no trouble plugging into new systems. But I also feel very alone. I have a life path that is almost completely unsharable with anyone else in the world. I'm tired from perpetually designing myself to fit in rather than being my authentic self--if I could even identify what my authentic self is at this point. And an awful lot of that stems from the decisions made by an elementary school kid that never got revisited. 

Going back to that earlier you allows you to revisit that decision and use your current perspective to find improved solutions. To peel away the security walls set up to protect that earlier you and allow yourself to grow beyond that point. To add new, healthier rings to the cross-cut you're creating. 

For me, one piece of corrective action is writing again. The things I wrote in the past weren't any more or less interesting or profound than what I'd write today; it's just that over time I subconsciously restricted myself from writing. People started becoming aware of my blog and so I worried about exposing my real thoughts. Employers had opinions that differed. Someone who I interacted with in some way might take issue with an opinion I shared. So Leftsider posts became longer, more thoughtful and less frequent. 

But writing has always been a great way for me to explore, express, and present what's on the inside of me. It also was the motivation for the regular maintenance and development of this blog and domain. Writing helps me think slower in a world where I'm constantly moving and reacting and multitasking. 

Besides, I'm an old man now and I can get rid of some of this "trying to fit in" business. I'm past the age of being a poster boy or a promising young talent. I owe it to myself--back then and now--to know and love myself fully, to be who I am and care less about how that plays out with others. Truth is, you can't predict or change how people think of you. You can't ensure your actions won't offend or disappoint the world around you. But you can't be compassionate to others and not have appreciation for yourself. I am nothing to be ashamed of. I am deeply flawed and still perfectly fine. And I've got a pretty good life despite all those shortcomings. I'm happy I can now recognize that.

The story playing in my head is that you've got quite a bit going on, and those things are going pretty well. 

Most of those things are new things; things you've worked hard to realize or that have come about in their own way--but all in the years since we last saw each other. 

The story playing for me shows you unsure that you want to bother reconciling a casual acquaintance from yesterday with the realities of your now. But you're not a jerk so it feels wrong to not respond when a random leftsider appears. 

I totally connect with that story--I made it up after all--so most of me wants to let you be, not be a pest. But a slice of me says new Austin [redacted] might be an awesome and inspiring presence to two randos kicking off their own new Austin thing.

I know I can be better at things than I am currently. I know that I'm not being true to myself. Yet it's difficult to do otherwise, conditioned to look for acceptance in the eyes of others.

I know each brick must be formed in order to build a wall. I know that real things require persistence. Step by step; eating the elephant one forkful at a time. This in a world of impatience and impermanence, interruptibility and disposability. I want it all now and it shouldn't be difficult. 

In light of these things, I need to be patient with myself. Accept who I am and bring what I can more fully into each moment. In time, I'll look back and recognize change.

BODY:
With another Somatica session under the belt, I have truly drunk the kool-aid. So much personal insight gained and program intention realized; I find myself either thinking or talking about it everyday. 

For me, halfway through the training program, Somatica presents two profound challenges: accepting yourself and being vulnerable as often as possible. 

Accepting yourself is deceptively complex. Listening to your body; recognizing that the critical voice in your head is a learned practice. Reviewing the experiences that shape your thinking and doing; resisting the urge to shame past actions and instead recognizing your capacity to thrive in adverse conditions without the benefit of hindsight. Seeing how your past makes you and not trying to correct anything; instead, recognizing both the good and the bad as who you are, loving who you are, and stepping forward into life with new strength and context. 

That is the type of arduous work that a) is lifelong and b) you won't want to keep hidden. So you practice that self-acceptance in your daily life, and in doing so develop empathy with others who are in varying stages of their own self-acceptance. First with your closest circle, then with your acquaintances, and then with the world at large--you present your authentic self: exposing your true feelings, stating your needs, establishing boundaries. Sharing all this with others so that they have an opportunity to learn how to love and work with the real you. Accepting not everyone will want to learn, and some may even dislike and oppose you; persisting in self-love and external empathy rather than shielding yourself from rejection--because that shield also restricts connection, emotion, growth and creativity.

During the second module, I shed tears over hurt I've harbored for years. Then, the next day, I shed tears of joy marveling at the brilliance of my lovely niece during a post-session visit. The following day I shed tears twice for the struggles of others in the training who shared vulnerably with me. And suddenly I was filled with emotion: love, acceptance, happiness even through pain, hope, peace, acceptance. 

Imagine the struggle to regulate all these feelings returning back to the office! I nearly cried explaining to my newest hire the hope I had for her and our team and the desire I had to help her be great at her job. But like all things, in time we settle back into our routines...I'm not emotionless yet but I'm feeling the feels at a much more stable level. I hope I can hold on to it and not let it fully recede.

BODY:
Your somewhat-humble author is blessed in many ways, and doesn't often use this medium to speak to the ways in which his life is great. I try to avoid using this blog as a platform for whining and moaning, but I haven't been nearly as intentional about speaking to the bright side. 

Today my intention was to share the tensions that exist in the relationship that I have with my parents, but it must first be said that I have parents--parents who I love. My parents aren't perfect, and they have their issues, but they have been nothing but supportive to me and have been great parents to my sister and I. The tension that I have with my parents is less about them and more about me; less about the parenting they provided and more about my projections and expectations around who they should be for me now in adulthood. 

My parents are divorced and remarried. They've re-partnered with nice people who are a) nice to them and b) are comfortable with my sister and I and open to being a part of our family. This is huge, apparently. The fact that my father can joke with my mother's husband and that my mom can chat amicably with my dad's wife is something that I may have taken for granted as a holiday gathering norm. It wasn't always that way, but I am so proud of the path my family has chosen to take in this regard. 

My sister and I sometimes express mildly exasperated resignation when speaking to each other about our parents. We're adults now, and that always changes the things you looked at when you were children. When you are the same age as the schoolteacher you start to realize with more accuracy what your teacher's life might have been when you viewed them as a font of wisdom. When you are older than your doctor or therapist, you might find yourself wondering whether their context is as comprehensive as you need it to be. And when you're all grown up (and in my little sister's case, a parent) you look with rose-colored glasses at the greatness of your parents past efforts, casting a deep shadow over who they are now.

To this end, I think it would only be fair to revise my thinking about my parents. They were my parents, so I guess I want them to be parents to me still. To have more insight than me, to provide counsel and guidance; to have an opinion about who I am and what I am potentially becoming. The reality is that perhaps that phase of my relationship with my parents may be yielding to a new phase where--I don't know--they're more like friends or old people who I've known my whole life. 

But regardless of how awkward the current transition is, despite the frustration that might arise in our interactions, and even though they stress me out at times (most times, honestly), my life is great in large part because of them, and I am thankful for each moment I have with them.

BODY:
Recently been thinking about how little of my life is according to plan. You can think of that in two ways. 

If I were to say that my life doesn't always go according to plan, most would share that feeling. And it is true that little of my life has turned out the way I expected it to--to the extent that it's not uncommon to hear me on a soapbox suggesting that nothing that is realized ever matches the picture you had of it in your head. We betray ourselves by leaning too heavily on projections we derive and expecting the world to conform. My life has not turned out how I planned but it is still a very good life--arguably better than what I could have imagined. 

Which leads to the second way of thinking about this. I have a life that is unimaginable for many--if not most. This is not a boast but a fact--one that I try to remind myself of each day. An early influencer recently admonished me, "...[N]ever forget that this is an honor. Not something you've earned or is owed to you... [T]reat each day as a privilege." So I am acutely aware that for me to say that I don't wake up to an alarm clock or have any specific time to wake up, I don't have a point in time where I'm "early", "late" or "on time" as far as being in the office, I largely can choose to work remotely at my whim, and I am the primary actor in defining my job and career path is a truly rare position that I'm truly fortunate to have. It makes me want to do the most with it and to not squander what so many dream of achieving.

So I worry that the lack of imposed structure results in the lack of structure overall. If someone isn't planning my life and how it should be lived, the responsibility lies with me. If I don't have a plan, and don't build structure so that my efforts, energies and resources are going to a specific thing (or set of things), all of the privilege and opportunity I'm afforded is lost. Perhaps I need to reassess and find something worth planning my living around.

BODY:
Part of turning 40 (!!) was coming to terms with my relevance in society. It's still a work in progress. 

I live in a young people city and I work in an industry with a youth fetish, so there's this constant immersion in twenty-somethings that makes it hard to live like my twenties ended a decade ago. What do 40-something people do besides raise children, chase youth, and hate life? I don't have an interest in any of those things, and I don't know many people who are at this stage of life who are doing something other than that. 

So I've started making a list of things that I can do, in relative obscurity, for the next half of my life. 

* **Build and maintain flexibility and mobility.** I've always enjoyed athletics and physical activity, but my feelings of not being a great sportsman and my (probably related) lack of competitive spirit usually relegated me to sporadic, non-organized exercise. I tried the gym, but I've always felt my gym activity generates personal narcissism. That said, I've been discovering people who are in [great shape](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt_9VoWBKeR/?igshid=h0x4wp7ikg91) who are doing [great things](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz-6LhlHZ5l/?igshid=4593uoqar9mi) that are [not about competition or vanity](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzLISqbIigp/?igshid=3nwrhar9vxib). And that looks like something I could do for a while without too much preening or acting like I'm not a bald fart.
* **Code.** I really miss the good old days of this site, when it was as much about building as it was about writing. Learning HTML and CSS was such a big thing for me back then, and gave me so much opportunity. It's sad that I do absolutely zero of that now. Moreover, I'm increasingly drawn back to my roots by the magnetic waves of the [indieweb movement](https://indieweb.org/). The web was made for building your own thing and representing yourself to the world--not for sharing your insignificant opinion on absolutely everything that happens in an ecosystem designed to [extract your data for profit's sake](https://medium.com/@leftsider/the-tangled-graph-we-weave-581f842279ff). Why not build my own thing and expand myself in the process? Also, despite all of that anarchist anti-conglomerate speak I'd still love to work at Google before it's all done and they tend to only hire people with real coding chops. 
* **Read and write.** Once upon a time this used to be "learn languages." But as much as I still love learning languages I realize that a big part of what pushed me to learn languages was to meet and impress new people. As an old, looking to engage with other olds, there are fewer people looking to find a novel foreigner who is speaking their language once you hit this age. I think if I maintain my abilities through reading and writing it will allow me to enjoy the efforts of my younger years for a long time. There's also general reading and writing on this blog to be done as well. 
* **Learn about myself.** Look, no one really cares what I do now that I'm 40. This is why the olds stop trying to know the latest songs, memes and fashion trends. You get almost no value from being in the know, because you're still an old. So why not take that precious effort and direct it somewhere that matters? [My somatica training](http://leftsider.com/cgi-bin/mtos5/mt-search.cgi?search=somatica&IncludeBlogs=3&limit=20) started at 40, and it's changed so much of how I see the world. Why stop there? I'll still be old and irrelevant, but at least I'll be happy and growing as I become a living fossil. 

In all seriousness, it's really important to make LIVING something you do until you're dead. I intend to do that.

BODY:
I was laid off in October, and while [I had plans](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2018/11/leftsider-unemployed.htm) not everything went according to them. By January I'd accepted that this might need to be a complete do-over--a long and arduous growth period. So I decided to be open to 2019 as a "[break it and remake it](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2019/03/making-it.htm)" year. 

Now that we're in the last few months of the year, I can see some major fragments I'm dealing with from the initial break from what was my prior reality:

1. **Moving to Austin.** The obvious big shakeup was moving from the bay, which I'd honestly been dreaming of doing but wasn't able to do on my own. There was a lot about California that I tolerated at best, so it was refreshing to be free of that. Additionally, Austin is a cool town with a wonderfully relaxed vibe that wasn't about to drain me of every penny just to live happily. But even so, it wasn't (and isn't) the place I wanted to be. I had an opportunity to move to Toronto collapse in February; only now am I recovered from that enough to say that Austin is both pleasant and [not where I want to be](http://leftsider.com/leftsider/2019/09/wanting-things-feeling-things.htm).
2. **Working in Austin.** So the shakeup had me heading true north and ending up in the south. The job is cool and challenging and international, but it's also another startup venture that comes with volatility and uncertainty. And let's make it plain: I blew threw a ton of savings living in California after the last startup, and I have practically no network here. So it feels a lot like I'm operating without a safety net, which is known to have an impact on morale. I'm loyal to a fault, but I need to be smart enough to say that regardless of my loyalty I need another job in my back pocket. 
3. **Making something new.** Perhaps due to the tenuous stability that is my existence, there doesn't seem to be a lot of newness coming from this remake. It'd be perfectly fine, I guess, to remake what I already had, but why not use this opportunity to try something new? Perhaps a new skillset or even career path? I'm not sure what I want but it seems like much ado about nothing to end up with minimal shift of the proverbial needle.

I don't know that I'll have these three fragments sorted by year's end, though I don't know if that matters or if there was ever a timeline set for when "break and remake" would be done. I just wanted to name the things that are floating around me and to use this post to process them more formally.

BODY:
My job is headquartered in London, I'm in the UK this week with my reports.

Eating outside for lunch, the air felt so good, and the wonderful smell of the fallen leaves stirred my emotions. I felt sadness, though, and I chose to rest in it quietly.

Finally I spoke to my team, who'd left me to my own thoughts. "On a completely different topic, it's important to listen to yourself and know what you want. Maybe you can't get something you want right now, but it's important to acknowledge what it is you desire. If you suppress what you want, you suppress your desire, you're going to end up suppressing your feelings--and this will keep you from truly being happy. All of this to say... I'm really enjoying this autumn weather..."

"...and you're suppressing your feelings about the hot Austin weather?" one person joked.

"...that's right. I've spent time outside every day this summer, telling myself this is what I'll have to accept to appreciate Austin. And that may not be the right way to appreciate Austin--it may not be wrong way, either--the important thing is that it's ok for me to want this weather, to miss this weather I'm experiencing right now, and to feel a little sad even though I'm really enjoying it at the same time. I'm recognizing my feelings."

"This is important for you because you need to always listen to your feelings and know what you want. Every time we meet in our 1:1s I ask you how you're doing, how things are going, and whether the work is meeting your expectations. You will need to listen to your feelings, your desires, and know what *you* really want--which is something entirely different. The job may be great and you're getting promotions left and right...but it's not what you want. Only you can know this, and I want you to practice paying attention to this."

"I feel like you just diagnosed me without knowing," he said. "I want to be financially independent, but I feel like I'm suppressing so much in my life that I really enjoy to do that, be that. It's important to say what I want, even if I can't have it right now."

I am so blessed to have experienced [Somatica](http://leftsider.com/cgi-bin/mtos5/mt-search.cgi?search=somatica&IncludeBlogs=3&limit=20) and to have been able to practically incorporate it into my daily life. It isn't a perfect application, but I feel happiness to know that my team understands vulnerability, communicating feedback, listening to emotions and even attunement to some extent. I love that my team starts our weekly meeting with a couple deep breaths and that we work to celebrate our different approaches rather than compete against each other.

I'm thankful for the last few months' growth, giving me the ability to appreciate [wanting things, feeling things that just can't be mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BIVvX6GsFk) right now.

One of the teachers of Jewish law asked Jesus [what was the greatest of all the commandments](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12&version=NIV). He responded that the most important was to remember that God is one, and to love God with all one's heart, soul, mind and strength. 

The second, Jesus said, was to love your neighbor as yourself.

For those who believe in God, loving God is fairly straightforward. Love for your fellow man is something that even those who don't believe in God can support. Do unto others, we often say, as you'd have them do unto you. But that isn't fully what the commandment Jesus stated asks--it's says "as yourself."

I see that "as yourself being read two possible ways"

* Love your neighbor as you love yourself
* Love your neighbor as if they were you

In either case, the question must be asked, "Do you love yourself?" For many, I imagine the way they treat others is precisely the way they treat themselves: harshly, critically, and with unforgiving disappointment. I don't think that was the intended outcome. 

Think about how you treat yourself.  How much patience, love, acceptance, attention and encouragement do you give yourself?

For the past few years, I've dragged myself free of the bedsheets early on the first day of the year, looking for solitude, reflection and sunrise. This, along with my penchant for theming each new year, gave me a true feeling of starting fresh, however contrived that feeling might be.

So color me surprised when I woke up with my 2020 motto, "Brave new world," and headed to a vista point to find...intensely gray skies.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/leftsider/49336908861/" title="20200101_074833"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49336908861_226d4b995f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="20200101_074833"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Here's the part where I should tell you something profound or inspirational--sometimes the best finishes have cloudy starts, when in doubt be sure the sun is still there shining, something ridiculous like that--but instead I'm just going to say it was a bust. It was anticlimactic, I was surrounded by a lot of disappointed people (many who left early), and I was so busy trying to find a bright side that I failed to be anything close to mindful or reflective. 

Life sucks sometimes. You don't have to be perpetually positive, because the world isn't. Every day the world is as full of tears, confusion and misses as smiles, purpose and success. There's no difference between Jan 1 and any other day of your life; it's true. Welcome to a brave new world.

This year I've decided to give another attempt at the latest variation on the resolution theme: twelve one-month resolutions rather than one big annual one. I started listing all the things I wanted to do or try, things I wanted to get better and and goals I wanted to achieve. And then I remembered a concept that I encountered during Somatica last year:

Self-improvement can be a pretty fantastic cover for self-hatred.

Think about any area where you'd like to improve and ask yourself, "do I love and accept my current position in this area? Or do I want to improve because I currently feel insufficient in some way--not enough?" Maybe there's something you really want to do, but deep deep down your desire to do it is tied to some desire to be seen differently, or to prove worth or value, or to escape some shame or regret. 

I've taken on the task of rewriting my monthly objectives, turning away from self-improvement and towards personal growth. Instead of "be a better husband," perhaps a monthly goal to show my love and appreciation each day. I hope that if you subscribe to resolutions, you'll consider "resolve" your aspirations, love yourself and seek goals that yield greater personal growth and enrichment this year.
