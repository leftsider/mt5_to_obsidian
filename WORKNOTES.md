1. ~~script that makes markdown file~~
2. ~~script that makes markdown file with text~~
3. ~~script that makes markdown file with text from a source~~ *NEW*
4. script that makes markdown file with a portion of text from a source
5. script that makes markdown file for each portion of text from a source

got an idea for a different approach from [here](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter8/). probably not the most efficient since you keep having to open and close the file, but it does the work. Probably a more efficient way _on that page_ but don't let that stop progress. ha.

using info from the guru99 link from earlier to copy text, and I'm using info from [here](https://www.askpython.com/python/built-in-methods/python-print-to-file) to paste that text. Getting an error where I didn't correctly define the location of my sample text. Researching how to do that effectively.

Found the exported textfile from my blog, copied it to source_files/leftsider.txt  
Created file where I'll do the bulk of work, converter.py3  
Current idea: python script that breaks posts into markdown files?

Looking up creating a file... I should know this...   
Good info [here](https://www.guru99.com/reading-and-writing-files-in-python.html); might be able to skip some steps  

going to uplevel this by making the filename a timestamp. that way I can track my outputs as I test. I think I did this before in another project; looking before I bother writing something  

[Found it and used it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10607688/how-to-create-a-file-name-with-the-current-date-time-in-python). We now have a script that makes a file and can write text to it. Going to stop here for the day.
