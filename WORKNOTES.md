just scrap paper where I track my progress and thoughts

Found the exported textfile from my blog, copied it to source_files/leftsider.txt  
Created file where I'll do the bulk of work, converter.py3  
Current idea: python script that breaks posts into markdown files?  

1. script that makes markdown file
2. script that makes markdown file with text
3. script that makes markdown file with text from a source
4. script that makes markdown file with a portion of text from a source
5. script that makes markdown file for each portion of text from a source

Looking up creating a file... I should know this...   
Good info [here](https://www.guru99.com/reading-and-writing-files-in-python.html); might be able to skip some steps  

going to uplevel this by making the filename a timestamp. that way I can track my outputs as I test. I think I did this before in another project; looking before I bother writing something
